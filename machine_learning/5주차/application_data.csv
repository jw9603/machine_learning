"The app has a lot of content, from meals to meditation to exercise. However, I would be very useful if the app and website worked. There are constant crashes stating, ""My session has expired."" Apparently, this has been an issue before. Usually it fixes itself within a short amount time, few minutes, but today has been different mirroring peoples' issues for the past few years.",2,12,2023-08-26 13:34:07
"I have a subscription, but as I navigate through the app I keep receiving a message saying my session has ended and I keep needing to log back in. I need to do this MULTIPLE times within a few minutes. It's making the app unusable. Extremely disappointed by this. Also, please add the ability to keep the timer going on workouts when I lock my phone. I'm not trying to keep my phone screen on for an entire 40 minute period.",1,21,2023-08-21 18:58:42
"The program and workouts are great. The main issue is that the app is borderline unusable. I have a Galaxy Ultra and it kicks me out to log in almost every time I select a workout. Some mornings I can't even use it all together (about half). Don't buy it until this is fixed. Customer service's response was ""Use our free YouTube channel"".",1,45,2023-08-25 11:54:49
"Doesn't work half the time. You can't open most of the workouts and it randomly signs me out when I try to access the app. Clearing cache and uninstalling it doesn't work. It sometimes takes days before it'll work again. I've emailed support numerous times and was told they are aware of the issue and a fix will be out eventually. What BS is that?! For the cost of this app, I should be able to expect that it works every time. Even when it does work, it's good but not great.",1,48,2023-08-21 15:18:24
"Could use some more personalized features. Would be nice if it had better descriptions available prior to the coached workouts. I'm traveling alot and my internet connections are ""unreliable"" so would be nice to stage/download workouts on my phone. They do seem to refine and update often. All in all, I've found it's generally been a great app for my needs.",4,19,2023-07-24 12:50:26
Worked great for the first month. Now I can't even get into the app. When i log in I'm automatically logged right back out and it says Session timed out... so now I can't access any of my workout program or meal plan! I couldn't even get in to cancel my subscription if I wanted to! I need this problem fixed because I do enjoy the app a lot... when I can actually use it!,2,4,2023-08-27 15:44:17
"I liked the app for a long time, and the workouts are good and helping to reach my goals. However, currently, I'm experiencing an issue where it constantly logs me out and takes several attempts to work, if at all. I am hoping that the membership fee is prorated for this consistent timing out.",4,5,2023-08-24 01:04:54
"So sad to write this as the workouts are great but I've been unable to login for a week and a half on any platform. That's just not acceptable on a paid workout app. And it's not the first issue I've had. This isn't hard - it's not like medical records or encrypted chats or anything, it's literally a list of workouts, that's it. But it's been a significant interruption to my routine so sadly I'll be finding a new platform.",1,5,2023-08-28 01:24:54
"Rarely ever glitches and just great workouts. This app and the programs and meal planning are very well done. There hardly ever glitches or mistakes in the coached workouts and the team does a great job of providing helpful queues while allowing us to do our thing a sbest we can. I haven't tried to make a meal yet but with everything portioned out and all you have to do is cook it, I can't wait to try because the meals just look so good! They have vegan, vegetarian, gluten free options/solutions",5,22,2023-06-20 19:47:54
"I haven't been able to access my programs reliably for 2 weeks. I used to love using this app for workouts, but this frustration has made me reconsider renweing my subscription. They sent out an email announcing a new program 6 days ago, even while the app is unusable. Smooth.",1,5,2023-08-28 19:26:15
"The app is a complete joke but the workouts are great when you can get to them. My free trial was great, really happy with it. As soon as it wasn't free anymore the app doesn't work. It constantly asks me to sign in and I can't get to my coached workouts. 2nd day in a row. On the verge of canceling",1,8,2023-08-25 13:46:38
"This app is completely worth it! What really sets this apart for me is the mixture of workout, nutrition, and mental health. The meals are easy and delicious, even my teenager will eat them. The workouts are just right, with a lot of options. I love all of the educational information that is shared. The meditation, breathing exercises, and calming sleep sounds really help me to focus on de-stressing my life. The planner makes it really simple to follow.",5,21,2023-05-31 04:44:15
"The app is awesome, The workout options are awesome, The food is awesome, everything is awesome..... Except one thing. You cannot use this app without an internet connection. I spent more than $100 in internet fees trying to get it to work on a cruise ship. Likewise, while working in an area with bad internet; I wasn't able to use it while traveling for work.",1,6,2023-08-10 14:53:57
"It's been pretty good so far! The app runs smoothly and there are a lot of different workouts to choose from. The recipe selection is awesome as well! My only constructive criticism would be with the workouts themselves, sometimes the trainer who is supposed to be doing to beginner version gets caught up in the work out and does the advanced. It makes it hard to follow if you need a lower level without having to back out of the workout and find the beginner level example. It's great though!!!",4,21,2020-04-11 17:48:50
"It's good. Gets the job done. Wish there were more focused workouts. Like just arms, legs, core...most are all body. Is definitely a more individual style. Less interaction. And they video in segments that they mix and match, so you'll repeat segments in different workouts. The voice over can be a little weird sometimes. For the most part, I like it. I get a good sweat it. It's cheap, the music works for me and settings are beautiful. I do wish there was a way to track the workouts you do.",4,10,2020-07-12 22:56:30
Pros: The workouts are great and the recipes seem good. Cons: uses all your data. Everything on the app requires you to be online at all times and you can't download anything even the shopping list. The workouts are one long video so if you accidentally touch the screen while working out you lose your place and have to manually find your place every time. Screen has to be open for the videos to play. This app was not worth the price.,2,77,2020-10-09 05:38:13
"I downloaded Centr because of the free trial offered during COVID-19, and ended up paying the annual subscription after the trial. I enjoy the app because it does a majority of the thinking for you, and I've seen quality results. There is a variety of nutrition options and workout styles. Most meals are very quick to make, and I've been able to complete all of all workouts I've tried under an hour (in a gym and at home). The interface is very user-friendly as well. 10/10, I recommend.",5,8,2020-06-15 20:22:20
"I signed up for the year package. So far I think the app design is beautiful, love the recipes and most of the workouts! But it is incredibly irritating that so many of the workouts are duplicates of each other (or very very similar within each of the trainers). I would prefer to have fewer different workout to choose from than having to look through 100 workouts to find one that is unique from the others. Could also use some work with the filtering system and be able to sort by workout time.",3,58,2021-04-08 15:48:19
"Initially I really loved this app, however the longer I use it the more I've realize how repetitive everything is. I've done 2 of the 6 week challenges now and its just the same few workouts over and over. Even the commentary is repeated over and over. Don't even get me started on how horrible the music is. I really appreciate the live workouts they are not so monotonous.",3,18,2020-07-10 19:10:25
"When I first began using this app I was a little discouraged. Most of the exercises were hard for me even at the beginner level. But when the Unleashed program came out, I was able to do the low impact options, and now I'm becoming stronger. I don't feel discouraged anymore and I'm utilizing the features of this membership even more. The trainers keep you focused and moving forward.",5,16,2020-07-05 17:45:18
"Excellent app! Easy to navigate, especially through workouts and meals. The shopping list function rocks! I love that you are able to adjust the meals for the amount of servings and the shopping list automatically adjusts the amount of ingredients needed. The meditations put my 11 year old to sleep. And for the boy parents out there you know that isn't easy! This is everything I have been looking for💖",5,2,2020-06-12 20:02:33
"Workouts are great. Food is also good-- always going to be one or two recipes you don't like, but over all most are really tasty! The Facebook group is a great community. Informative, encouraging and the people are funny as hell too 😂 Not a fan of the meditations for the most part as I prefer more reflective and body oriented than the visual guided style. They do have a mix of both, but so far no way for you to swap them out if you prefer one over the other. Overall great app!",4,12,2020-11-15 22:27:13
"A couple things I would change is 1. The ability to exclude equipment-based workouts for those who don't have the equipment or a gym to go to, and 2. Being able to make a meal plan that focuses on a few ingredients, rather than many. I can't afford to go and buy a massive variety (especially at the price of this app), and going through to handpick your meals kind of defeats the purpose of paying for at least that portion of the app. Great app for those with the money and time.",4,41,2020-12-04 14:15:55
"This app has changed my life!!! I've always been skeptical of any type of online/app style workouts but Chris & his trainers have put together a fantastic platform for anyone who wants to try it out (no matter what level you're starting at!). I absolutely love the added touch of meals & snacks. Eating healthy has always been my hardest struggle with getting in shape. Not because I don't like healthy food, but because my options to cook at home always seemed so limited. Centr is the best program!",5,23,2020-08-10 16:43:10
"Tried the free trial and was absolutely blown away and had to get the year subscription! A fantastic change of pace to my fitness regimen and a welcome switch up for my home programming. I love that it requires almost no equipment and still kicks your ass. The food choices are great, too. While I haven't done every single meal it's loaded, I have really enjoyed the choices I have done and love the fact that it creates a shopping list for you. Grade A+++",5,7,2020-04-22 23:02:07
"Don't bother with the reviews saying it's all about the $. I cancelled minutes before the week trial was up (based on the time stamp) and wasn't charged. Gave it some thought and signed up. The workouts are very well structured, I would only suggest that they add a alternative to every exercise. They have it for some but not all. The recipes alone have been worth the $. VERY easy recipes to make a lot of healthy food. I cook 95% of my meals, and these are some of the easiest recipes ever.",5,39,2021-11-09 20:22:04
"Great app with room for improvement. The workouts are well structured and accessable but challenging. Love the variety of programs. The variety and quality of the meals and snacks are fantastic. At $10/month it's worth it for me. Some small annoyances: - There's no intro on how to use the app. You have to dig. - Self-guided workouts can't be cast to TV - No instruction (on form, etc) with the self-guided weightlifting. - Only syncs w Google Fit if you use mobile app, not website. Overall great!",4,26,2021-04-23 16:37:10
"A great app if you like working out at home. Different styles of work outs, different types of coaches. Has something for everyone, whether you're a beginner or more advance; it has meal planning, meditation. The only thing that prevented me from rating it 5 🌟 is some workouts can get repetitive and I would like if it can be a little more interactive .",4,11,2020-05-18 19:45:17
"Best investment, in my opinion. I'm self motivated and sometimes require a little direction, variety, and on occasion, a push. This app makes everything easy. The robustness of the workout variety is perfect for those days where I need something different. Because you know, it's opposite day. The meals are wonderful and the tracking is on point. Thanks Centr team!!!",5,25,2022-02-23 19:56:19
"I was skeptical at first, but the wealth of knowledge shared by these pros alone is worth it. Being able to swipe individual sets, jump into an all-new workout when you're not feeling it, and the nutritional tips are all fantastic. I do wish there was a log that would record all your completed workouts/meditations on one page, but maybe they'll update to include in the future ;)",5,35,2020-08-12 21:47:31
"update: so I signed up and tried the app, but just couldn't get into the workouts. enjoyed the meditation though. so I cancelled, but I still see I've been billed for three one year! 🙁 -‐------------------- Cant use free 7 day trail without signing up for a 1, 3, or 12 month subscription! I download with the intent to try it for 7 days to see if I liked it, but I don't like that it forces you into a subscription before you get to try it!",1,28,2020-02-04 18:21:07
"Overall pretty great app and program. A few shortcomings: meal plans are unrealistic unless you have a lot more time and money than the average person. Need a way to star/favorite certain workouts, curate our own plans. And definitely need a Roku app. But there's still a lot to like here, sticking with it for now.",4,4,2020-06-07 23:32:01
Have been using the app for 8 months now. Did the 1 year subscription. At first it had bugs but they worked them out. Easy to use and they keep making it better. They add new workouts and recipes to keep it fun. I took a few workout breaks as life got busy but could not give up the food. Doesn't feel like a diet. I just know how to cook now... If you stick to it getting into shape is inevitable. Highly recommend!,5,11,2020-04-29 01:48:47
"Fantastic app!!! Love the recipes, the workouts, and the meditation exercises! However this app is ungodly expensive, and I'm not talking about the subscription (which is also expensive) but the amount of groceries you need to buy, and time to make everything! Plus it often includes at least one ingredient I've never heard of and have to play detective to find. This app is a full time job! 100% recommend if you have free time and a good amount of disposable income. However this app is great!!",4,48,2021-02-11 23:47:43
"This app has everything you need and then some! I am never disappointed with a workout I conquer or a meal I choose to make! It has a variety of options at a variety of fitness levels. The meal planner has amazing options, things I would never thought I could eat while trying to get fit! It even has content that helps with mindset and mental health! The app is easy to use and functional, and gets better with every update!",5,19,2020-07-24 00:51:57
"I've been using the Centr site since the beginning, which had done pretty well on my Android phone. The workouts themselves are better for those looking to improve flexibility, the muscle building options are just ""ok."" This app was worth the wait! Buttery smooth interface, the workout checks off as complete when I'm done (the web version did not), and I can play my music while the video plays and still hear the trainer. Well done! 👏",5,32,2019-12-16 23:58:07
"Lots of potential, good so far! Workouts are good, but not a whole of options or flexibility just yet on programs or customizations. Nutrition menu looks good, but the variety every week makes it seem like the menu is meant for people with a lot of discretionary funds, especially when trying to cook for just one person. With COVID, a lot of my workouts were limited in equipment. I was saddened to see that Centr didn't allow for pausing of subscriptions or extending subscriptions though",4,4,2020-06-01 18:42:06
"I tried the first day for workouts and tried the meals and it is good. I like the wide variety of options that Centr offers. But, my one annoyance is that if my phone rotates or I change screen, the fitness app loses my progress through a workout. I have to scroll back down to where I was, which can be frustrating. I would of sent a note in the app with this suggestion but there isn't a section for that.",4,9,2019-12-17 18:26:53
"Work outs are good. I am at advance level. My reason for the one star is that the app doesn't work very well on Mac laptops, iPad, or Android phones. Yes I tried trouble shooting. There isn't much description of the movements either. No constant coaching just doing. And sometimes the videos keep going and going until you make it change next.",1,13,2020-04-05 18:40:13
"Not a terrible app, but has its flaws. A lot if videos on the app don't load fast enough to really keep watching one after one and it sucks to work out and have to wait for the video to load. Has good recipes and good workouts, including modifications for if you don't have all the equipment. Wish the workouts had some more variety though. Aside from those issues its $40 for a month! Which i only got because I had accidentally forgot to cancel my free trial.",3,18,2020-04-26 05:07:49
"Potential, but the app is too busy. There is a lot of content in this app, but unfortunately that strength is also a weakness. It's pretty hard to navigate around and find plans and programs that are right for you. Most modern fitness apps using AI and machine learning to tailor specific workouts to you based on goals, body weight, fitness experience, etc. This one makes you wade through a sea of opens and plans that quickly become overwhelming. More surveys with custom recommendations plz",3,21,2021-11-15 17:16:31
"I have enjoyed the app so far. It is easy to use and understand. The built in shopping list is arranged well, but could be improved to group things where you'd get them in the store, versus pantry item etc... The workouts and amazing and worth the subscription. If your in shape or want to get in shape/back into shape I highly recommend it. Give it a shot, what can it hurt aside from muscle soreness.",5,5,2020-05-26 01:09:35
"This app is by far the best exercise app I've ever personally used or heard of. I think most of what makes it so great is the planner which automatically plans your meals and gives you your workouts. There are small places where improvements could be made - I'd like to be able to add a program directly to my planner, and it would also be nice if there was a list of things that I should keep stocked in my kitchen for the meals, but those don't detract much from the perfect experience I've had.",5,63,2022-10-17 17:41:25
"Love it! I love that this app plans all your meals, including delicious snacks, workouts and meditation and sleep visualizations all in one. The meals are delicious and pretty easy to make with a delicious variety of snacks that are both savory and sweet. The workouts are challenging and you can adjust based on your level of experience.",5,4,2020-06-18 16:41:48
"The program is overall good, however, I'm giving 2 🌟 because the app crashes a lot. Sometimes it skip the rest, freezes and also it doesn't allow me to open it with my VPN. In addition, it looks like the body muscle program is made for men. Women have different body behavior and the program doesn't look to take it into account. I would like to see and improvement on it.",2,18,2020-07-03 14:01:28
"As someone who has done a few workout programs I would say this is my favorite so far. The meals they have aren't always easy to get ingredients for, but if you can make them they are tasty. You can swap meals, or can figure out your own diet plan. Being able to change the difficulty is great. The fact that you can swap a workout if you don't have the equipment or because you're feeling something else is an awesome benefit of this app. This is an awesome program. Thanks Chris and team!",5,2,2020-05-16 19:26:51
"They've built the workouts with alternative exercises for those who don't have fancy workout equipment at home. They include meditation guides and healthy recipes. I don't bother with them myself, but I appreciate the option. Personally, I prefer going to a gym with a coach who can guide me right then and there, but this was nice to have with covid shutting everything down.",3,2,2020-05-26 17:57:46
"Best whole person wellness app I've used!! As a wellness professional I looked for something to recommend to my clients that they will stick to. This has everything in one place (Workouts, Guidance, Meal planning/education, meditations) and they plan it out for you according to your preferences. You can swap out things that aren't what you want for that day easily. Love it🤩🤩🤩💯",5,4,2020-07-21 17:38:21
"Really not worth it as someone with an appreciable fitness background. Functional training workouts are good, but Torre workouts are repetitive and stale, focus too much on legs and overall the program is cookie-cutter, not very adaptive. I actually lost strength and some size in my three months on the program (used it through browser because the app wasn't out). It is a good for weight loss, toning up (maybe) or just starting, but not built for gaining muscle. Food is expensive.",1,26,2019-12-16 13:41:52
This app had really kick-started my fitness journey. I've been struggling for a while with eating and exercising. I started this during a free trial and liked enough that I opted to keep the subscription. They have guided and self-guided workouts with everything from no equipment to heavy equipment. They have some great recipes to enjoy. I've only been using the app for a few weeks but am already seeing and feeling results. I'm starting to look forward to exercising in the morning with this app.,5,6,2020-05-07 23:50:22
"The app is amazing! It's very convenient, exercises are shown with varying difficulties for beginners, intermediate and advance users. Alternative workouts also shown, excellent recipes that cater to vegans,vegiterians and everybody else with adjustable serving size. Please add option to save favourite recipes for easy access or add like/dislike option on recipes so that they can be repeated or replaced in the future.",5,1,2020-06-01 17:24:43
"Love that the app guides you on how to use it. Can be a little confusing at first. The couches guide you through the workouts before you actually start and you can pick whatever level of fitness to accommodate you. The positive podcast, health articles & sleep meditations are great. The meals are amazing and you save a grocery list on the app so you dont forget. Would recommend to anyone no make what level of fitness you're at.",5,3,2020-04-11 20:45:39
"You don't have to be Hemsworth for these exercises. They vary from absolute beginner to will hurt you with or without weights. Huge variety of exercises and recipes. They'll choose your foods for you and give you a shopping list if you want. The price is steep monthly buy quickly gets cheaper with a longer subscription. I've tried other apps but this one is the best, hands down.",5,29,2020-12-05 01:06:53
"Now with Chromecast support... Mostly First things first: the program works for me. Keeps me engaged, coming back, and it's constantly adding content. The app is now finally better than the mobile site. Quicker to start, search, no signing out after every session, etc. Now for the ""bad"": Chromecast is only available for coached workouts and programs, not self-guided. New releases aren't properly announced. I found out about centr6 through a third party news article weeks after release.",4,2,2020-05-13 22:38:03
"Great workouts! They are easy to follow, no matter you level. The app shows you how to do each workout as you are working the plan, instead of having to remember how to do the exercise... Which could lead to you doing it with or with bad form and hurting yourself! I'm glad I started using the app. My focus was one the weighted workouts, but the recipes and other exercises is a great addition to what I was looking for.",5,7,2022-01-17 16:13:32
"Superb, less of an app and more of a way of life. What I love is both the variety of extremely great exercises that includes everything from straight up weights to yoga and Pilates to some new styles of functional training and boxing, but also a huge selection of food and snack options, meditation and wellness advice. You can easily search and find what you want, or just let the system guide you based on your preferences. Can't recommend enough!",5,14,2021-03-26 14:22:10
"Great workouts with variety so far. Love the daily checklist of things to do with exercise, articles and meditation all in one place. Meditation and mindfulness is something I need more of and I appreciate the daily programming. Tried some meals but found them a bit bland so paused for a bit. May try later again. Overall even without using the meals worth the price IMO.",5,11,2021-04-24 14:02:52
"I was using the website for almost a year when the Android app finally released. Centr is reasonably priced, has great variety of workout types with enough routine built in to stick with it, and solid recipes with a meal plan schedule (this is harder to stick with for me since I get bored of meals quickly). The app is simple and works well. I do wish there were more features (some sort of stat log, sync to fitness tracker, etc), but I love the program.",5,4,2020-07-28 16:55:25
"I like this app. The recipes are surprisingly good. They use whole foods and consider texture, which is so important and often missed. I've also learned some important lessens about how to stay full during the day. I do wish the recipes were released more often, which may be asking too much. There is a big selection of exercise options. I need low to no impact and still found enough options to stay busy.",4,14,2022-03-01 04:56:52
"I know they are just getting started and I already love it, I know as they add more programs it will be even better, I love the modifications they offer also. Great app, great price. I have to agree with another reviewer about the warm up and cool down, a little variation would go a long way! It does get old to do the same (especially warm up) every day for weeks. Definitely not a deal breaker for me though :-)",5,25,2020-08-23 19:48:36
"Awesome all in one (meal, workout, meditation & sleep visualization) program. I've been using the app & program for almost 5 months now and love it. Having my workouts & meals in one app is a huge time saver for me personally. I have found the majority of the meals available to be very good and there is enough variety to where I have not had to make things over and over again. On a pure app basis the only issue I've had is meals not clearing when I hit done so I have to do this a couple times.",5,24,2022-04-23 22:11:45
"Great content and easy to navigate. I like that I can hit complete on a workout to track my progress in the Program, butit would be nice to filter which workouts I've completed in the other workouts. The big issue I have is with the meditation player. I'll hit play, exit the page and browse while it is still playing, return to same page but the player is reset while the same meditation is still running, which means I can't stop it. Playing a new one doesn't cancel the old, they just overlap.",3,19,2020-03-28 19:14:27
"Positive encouraging, non aggressive, while still pushing for more. Solid workouts that will give you what you put into them. Recommend seeing a personal trainer for a while to get your forms down and to modify exercises based on your body mechanics/restrictions. Still they have a good breakdown of forms at all levels so if you spend the time with them you will be able to do them properly. I originally signed up for 3 months, took a break, but am now on for a year. Solid app. Thank you.",5,45,2022-06-14 12:26:27
"Very polished and a well designed app. Love the cards based design and of course all of the info. Was training via the site option so having an app is incredible and convenient. One feature request is to have offline access similar to Netflix for example, at least limited for a few days when you travel and want to exercise but have no connection to wifi or network. A few other things are missing here and there, but otherwise love the program and the app. Cheers!",5,32,2019-12-20 17:57:44
"I LOVE this app! I never have to miss a workout when I'm out of town, and I always have the shopping list I need to make the meals for the week. I am thankful for the variety of workouts, the amazing and talented coaches, the helpful articles, and the great tasting meals my whole family enjoys! The layout is super easy to follow.. workout, meals and meditations all in one place. Couldn't be happier!!! Thank you, Centr!!!",5,11,2020-02-18 22:50:03
"Brutal, but in a good way! The app runs well and is trimmed down of features on others that I would never use. Casting to my TV makes workouts easy to do throughout my house and convenient when travelling. The team seems to really know their stuff and sort through the technical aspects to being you the most user friendly and seemless experience. Also having workouts based around bodyweight or minimal equipment is perfect for quarantine and beyond. Here's to many days of sweat, pain, and gains.",5,1,2020-05-25 15:34:38
"Great daily workout plan. I am not able to use the diet plan as much as I would like, but when I have the food has been fantastic. It's great being able to just often the app and follow the routines it has. Love everything from the weights to the yoga. The only downside is not being able to save workouts in the event you don't have service (which I do with work frequently). Highly recommend this app!",5,14,2021-12-12 20:24:27
"Beautiful but only for the entirely able-bodied. The aesthetics are great and the coaches lovely, but there's no option to avoid high intensity exercises in the daily schedule. For someone like me with a back issue, I can't just go with the recommended lessons but have to go find the Pilates or yoga exercises they have for myself. It's a shame, as I had already purchased a three month subscription but can't use it as much as I'd like.",4,0,2020-11-29 15:24:08
"I'm very optimistic from what I've seen so far. I love that meditation is part of the regimen. There are a few features, however, that I've found to be very helpful but I've not found them in a single app. Please consider: 1. Integration with Google Fit/other fitness trackers. 2. Weight training trackers/log (what exercises, how much weight, how many reps etc) 3. Ability to sort/edit meals that include certain foods (eg diabetic menu, allergies, or just plain don't like certain ingredients?)",4,42,2022-04-23 01:08:30
"Good exercises and workout plans. Terrible customization and interface. Would be 5 if we could pick our own program, filter/exclude certain exercises, better logging and graphs to track progress. Overall it's a pretty app with good content, but that content is too hard to use outside of the force-fed 'program'",3,64,2022-12-09 17:44:58
"I have been using this for a month now, and it is good so far. I need to expand my weights at home tho as I progress through because from what I gather, the exercises only vary slightly as you go from begginer to intermediate, and up. The only disappointing aspect of the mobile app (I don't know if this holds true for tablets) is when I'm using the coached/guided workouts when my phone flips betwe portrait and landscape it starts the video from the beginning... Annoying when in the middle of it.",4,25,2021-04-07 14:01:36
"For the first time ever I remembered to cancel a subscription before the trial period ended, but imagine my surprise when I was charged the full amount just 2 days later. I assume there must be a mistake, and log online to find that I still have an account somehow. I cancel again, and contact customer service to sort this out. Only to be told that I never canceled and will not be receiving a refund. Even though I've canceled TWICE and contacted CENTR within 24 hours of the charge. Terrible.",1,359,2022-06-24 21:47:59
"Program is good, but app needs refining. Suggestions: easier way to cast (i.e. from video, not desktop or through screen mirror) - MUST.  Save shopping lists or meal plans. Create & save user defined workouts from the self guided workout clips (mix and match!). Favorite meal & workout function to make it easier to repeat liked, disliked, ambivalent. At the top of the shopping list, the app lists all recipes. This should be clickable and single recipes easily removed not just a clear all.",3,8,2019-12-31 01:17:01
"I love this app. It's what I have been looking for. The ability to like or heart your favorite workouts or meals would be awesome. 10/12/20- update: This continues to be a decent app, if I could change 1 thing, it would be the menu. It is nowhere near realistic for people who work. Designer meals arent practical.11/15/20- I know I can switch my meals, problem is that they are unrealistic. I can guarantee the maybe 2% of people actually make these meals.",3,20,2020-11-16 02:57:53
"I was very hesitant to try this app when my fiancee found it a few months ago. I've been working out and playing sports competitively my whole life but had taken the last year off of fitness due to a promotion at work that increased stress and hours tremendously. I just finished week 4 of the Centr 6 program and WOW! I see a massive change in my energy levels, overall health and mood and yes..I can finally see my abs again! (Mostly). I would recommend this app to everyone at all levels!!",5,1,2020-04-26 04:02:48
"Love it. Centr Unleashed!!! Getting me though it. Suggestion, for the couched workouts and the program workouts. Sometimes movement variations are given halfway through the set or in the second round. Would be more effective for the a beginner to these movements to have all the information before attempting something they cannot really do and potentially hurt themselves only to later find out there is something more manageable until they can safely to the other stuff.",5,0,2020-06-16 11:22:59
"Such an amazing work out app! I use it everyday and it is WELL worth the money! It's super functional and easy to use. It's great for all different types of people whether you're a beginner or more advanced, you WILL find a challenge with this app!! They also have different payment plans and options if you aren't interested in having the app for a 12 month period.",5,0,2020-05-31 13:35:17
"I'm really disappointed with this. It's cheaply done. The routines on the 6 are good, but unless you're an expert, you'll find even the easy stuff difficult 1) there's no 10 sec back button. If u pause your body, it's tough to catch up. 2) there are no play by play instructions. You need to watch them at all times, which makes focusing on what you're doing yourself very, very difficult. 3) they don't show you how to perform a move, they expect you to know everything before you work out.",2,29,2020-04-06 19:43:24
"The app itself is worth the money. When my trial ended however... it billed me for the full year (102$) which was unexpected. It was not clear how the billing would be handled i was under the impression it would be 8$ a month. Aside from that, there is a ton of good info on the app so- definitely worth it.",5,17,2020-12-08 16:16:22
"Your shopping list is lacking, particularly around the understanding that people have other things besides your recipes that they might want on the list. These things easy get unintentionally wiped when starting lists or removing recipes. Also, meditation is so much more than a new-agey stress ball. Your content in that area disappointing. Great workouts and recipes!",4,7,2021-10-08 00:29:37
"Pretty good programming for almost everyone. I would like to see a body part exclusion from a workout. Some of either get injured or have lifelong issues. To be able to stick with a workout plan, but have other exercises recommended for our exclusions would be perfect. Outside of that I'm having a lot of fun. P.s. $30/month I feel like Thor should be in the list of coaches I can choose to pull a workout from.",4,10,2022-04-15 20:48:14
"App and general experience are worth the money, compared to competing alternatives. But, there's no native ability to cast the apps videos to, for instance, a Google Chrome Cast. A workaround for this ""in home"" is to use the Web App and cast the whole desktop of your computer. But latency issues not related to the app persist with that method specifically when streaming video, which is the whole point of this. Would love to see casting ability worked in to the app in the future!",4,10,2019-12-17 12:14:07
"Great App! The workouts are phenomenal and give you the variety that you need. I've been doing the muscle build and have been able to modify to fit my sever back issue. The daily meditation is clutch though.. I started doing it before we were all dealing with the pandemic, so it was already in my routine and has helped me immensely with my sleep. Highly recommend!",5,2,2020-04-07 03:00:44
"The app and the content itself are great BUT there's no offline playback function. You can't download a workout, not even temporarily, and the only solution given for this is to use their workout image option in the self guided workouts. So old fashioned!! With a 25min vid chewing up >1GB you'd better be somewhere that has wifi or upgrade your data plan! Definitely need a fix for this.",4,13,2020-02-09 13:35:11
"Love the app, it helps me get high intensity work outs in without having to shell out for too much equipment. I wish there was an off line mode though, would make it easier to do work outs outside. My only concern is that there is not an easy way to change my subscription plan. I started with only 3 months because I wasn't sure how I would like it (I love it). But now I want to change to the yearly plan and I'm not able to do that from the app.",4,0,2020-06-06 14:36:48
"I LOOOOOOOVVVVEEEEE this app. The variety of workouts and meals (and I'm vegan) makes it so easy to stick to. There are only a couple things that would personally make this better. 1. For the shopping list to group items together better. 2. I would love to be able to add programs I'm doing to my planner. I love seeing my day all laid out. And just wink wink Centr, an app on smart TVs would take this over the top!",5,36,2020-12-03 06:56:39
"These are good workouts, & the app is pretty easy to navigate with planner, workouts (saved/active), meal planning/shopping list. Workout wise, if ur the type of person that pushes hard when an instructor suffers along & completes workouts, I'd rate a few, like Centr Unleashed 1* star. They record 1 set & repeat 3 times, so they don't really do the work with u all the way through. Even warm up & cool downs r copied & pasted in every track. Voice overs r weak & demotivating. Better muted.",4,4,2021-03-02 02:42:18
"Centr is solid overall and my go-to workout app recommendation for friends. So far, over the past year, I've only had 1 login issue, which was solved after a day or so, and a few errors with pulling up the daily workout (which resolved after a force close / restart of the app). There's something for every workout goal/style and the meal planner is hugely helpful with scaling around your fitness goals.",5,11,2022-01-27 14:52:35
"Outstanding. The program has lots of variety and some of the best pandemic-isolation-friendly body weight and minimal equipment workouts I've seen. It's also great to have meal planning options built right in, which you can use as much or as little as you want. The app works very reliably and supports Chromecast!",5,1,2020-08-01 01:49:20
"This is probably my least favorite workout app I've tried so far. The workout videos are really sub par. The instructions for exercises feel rushed and the trainers are just not that engaging. They feel really disconnected from their product, almost like they had to do it quickly to just get it over with. The exercise pool is also incredibly limited and focus heavily on equipment so if you're like me and only have dumbells, you'll quickly run out of routines.",1,14,2021-02-10 19:36:29
"This app lacks customization in regard to the program you are put into. Very little questions are asked about health and fitness levels. There are no real goals or encouragements. This is a no frills fitness/diet app. No step or calorie counter, but they do provide a really good daily menu. We are a vegan home. The recipes provided were nice and filling. You can adjust servings and are.provided a grocery list. I just don't feel this app is worth the money right now. It's too simplistic for me.",4,3,2023-02-24 14:02:20
"I've really liked the so far. Workouts are great. Food is great (but tough to keep up with at times with kids). My only complaint is that there isn't a built in reminder system to help plan the day in regards to workouts, meditations, etc. I sit at my desk all day, so at times I forget to get up and move. Having a helpful reminder in-app that would get me up to walk and read an article or maybe do a meditation would make this the ultimate app in my opinion.",5,36,2021-01-06 13:37:25
"Fantastic exercises and trainers. I like that they don't just spend an hour yelling at you, but instead assist with form/ real talk. It provides recipes that are more enjoyable and ""normal."" Only one problem, the unlimited advanced week 3 day 2 is not checking off after completing it. Haven't had this issue before now.",4,10,2022-04-19 16:52:56
"Variated workouts, meal plans and meditations. This app has a lot for everyone. I only wish the planner was updated more often, (I feel I'm repeating the same workouts now that I'm almost 4 months into it, I do 2 or 3 every day) and the ingredients for meals more accessible. The programs are great, challenging and fun. I'm enjoying it a lot. If you have a few dumbbells or kettlebells at home it's like going to a class at the gym. The facebook community is amazing.",4,19,2020-05-24 17:58:15
"I can't find how to favorite things yet if that's an option. If Icould find that, this would be a 5 star. The workouts are great and you can really get something that fits to your needs. Like a week after starting, I injured my knee and had to back off to the more gentle workouts but I'm slowly getting back into it now that I'm healing nicely. The recipes are also amazing. I would definitely try a lot of these and have already started going through them. I love the espresso soothe. Get this app",4,3,2020-04-30 21:58:02
They thought of everything for this app. I applaud the makers. I think the Centr app should be a case study for great UI and UX design. It has a shopping list for all the recipes that let's you cross off what you have and even categorizes them by grocery aisle sections. The workouts are great and meditations are so helpful. This app has helped me maintain a healthy lifestyle to be a better version of myself. 10/5 stars.,5,67,2021-04-22 12:32:24
"Pros: -combining nutrition planning and excercise classes is really helpful if you don't want to spend lots of time thinking about and planning those things-the programs are excellent, most of them are 4-6 weeks and give you a sense of real improvement and progress-i love tahl's dynamic yoga, she really makes you work. Cons-the recipes are not great, i often use them as a jumping off point and alter the spices and cooking methods. Many of the vegetarian options are unforgivably bland.",4,40,2022-08-19 23:04:27
"There support team is really awesome. When I first downloaded the app, connection to Google Fit worked, then about a month later it failed due to a security update. I contacted their team, and they had it fixed within the week. The workouts are fantastic, easy layout, and now a watch app too! Really enjoy it.",5,61,2023-01-16 13:37:13
"Just like having a personal trainer, at a fraction of the cost. I've been trying to eat healthier and go to the gym for the better part of a year. It's so hard to meal plan and hit all the macros. This plans out your entire week and gives you a shopping list depending on if you're try to loose, maintain, or gain. Plus also gives you corresponding workouts depending on the intensity and goals that you choose. For me, the app has worked well and any changes are reflected on my desktop PC.",5,10,2020-01-04 20:37:34
"I love this app! This is the first time I've used a 6 week fitness program from an app and really felt like it was working. The trainers are great at explaining the different movements and showing variations for low impact. They also do a great job at keeping me motivated for the whole workout! Instead of counting the minutes I have left, I'm always surprised at how quickly I'm done. I highly recommend this app for anyone that wants to get a great workout at home!",5,0,2020-05-25 18:18:54
"Great app so far! It makes health 10x easier by simply giving workouts and meals. Haven't had the app long and the only reason it isn't a 5 star for me is because I have yet to see change, but I have a feeling I will. A feature that would be amazing is something to help with a sleep schedule and something to keep you motivated.",4,5,2020-08-23 07:17:42
"The thing that's always kept me from going to the gym has been not knowing the proper form and workouts to do together to target the right muscles. The guided workouts have been great for this beginner! The only thing I wish they had incorporated in the workouts are cooldown stretches. (again, I don't know what to do to cooldown the muscles I just worked out 🤣)",5,15,2021-11-16 14:55:52
"Overall pretty good. I consistently get good workouts from the trainers. I really like the suggested meals and have found several favorites. Gripe #1 is you cannot download the videos for later, for those of us on metered plans this adds about 15 dollars to my phone bill. Gripe #2 while you can log your weights it's very basic logging. I would really appreciate a notes box to go along with the weight. I can't remember after a week if a particular set was challenging or not.",4,2,2021-08-10 03:24:02
"Great coaching and workout variety. One thing I've always struggled with is meal planning, and this app had perfect solutions. The planner allows you to switch out recipes, and pick out what fits your needs (vegan and gluten-free options are within the menu), AND my family likes the recipes. My spouse is especially excited now that I'm doing meal planning, and the meal planner even creates my shopping list for the week! The beginner level workouts are great at pushing without breaking the spirit",5,16,2020-07-30 12:18:41
"This app has saved me!! I purchased the app after I wasn't able to continue my martial arts training because of economic reasons. They have any and every type of workout for all levels. The coaches are so professional and funny, it makes it so much fun to follow the workouts even if you feel you are dying. The diet plan is so convenient and not as difficult as it might seems at first. During this quarantine it has been a true blessing to have this as a tool to keep up with my goals.",5,1,2020-04-05 18:46:53
"I've tried a few different programs over the past year, but if there is one that I have found really has helped me get back into Ice Hockey and Rugby shape, Centr has been one. It has covered everything from workouts to food/diet to meditations to articles about better sleep, all without getting stale, a problem I found with other apps. The trainers in it keep the guided work not only fresh, but very positive and encourage, something other apps seem to lose after a few weeks.",5,0,2021-02-17 06:55:39
"Excellent, easy to follow coached workouts with options for all levels. I also like the meditations and relaxation with expert trainers. Haven't used the meal planner much, but the few recipes I have tried are simple to prepare and tasty. Overall very happy with this program. It has been a saving grace with gyms closed.",5,3,2020-05-12 10:19:01
"I love it so far. Workouts: I chose the advanced and the workouts are tough! Some moves are currently impossible, but there are modifications. My favorite thing about the app is the meal plan functionality. It expidites my nutrition so I don't have to waste time with what I should make. Meals are tasty and quick to throw together. I use the vegan meal plan and I love that it is almost all whole foods. I have been trying to lose weight for a long time and it is finally happening!",5,23,2022-06-30 18:19:49
"This is the best fitness app I've ever used. It's balanced, joyful, funny, delicious, and makes me feel like I'm working out with my cool weird friends. The difficult level is actually challenging enough for a gym rat like myself (a problem I've had with most other apps), but the easy level is easy enough for my mom, who has many physical difficulties. The layout is GORGEOUS. It's a beautiful app, and I've never had an issue.",5,1,2020-08-08 15:23:37
Great total program for fitness. I love how intuitive the interface is and easy it is to work out at my own pace as I set up my home equipment. There is flexibility built in to swap out meals and workouts and articles that help me make the right decisions on what to swap when. Subscription is more affordable than some of the other premium workout apps that are $30 to $40 a month.,5,20,2021-08-10 13:46:19
"Great app for someone that's an introvert or isn't comfortable working out in public, it would be nice if there were more simple choices on the menu, I don't have access to a lot of specialty foods and also have a pretty simple palate. My kids love listening to Chris for meditation so I wish he had more. Overall though this has been a positive experience.",4,5,2020-06-30 12:45:14
"Decent app, holistic approach, but missing some important parts. Many nutrition-added fitness apps make the same mistake: no filter for allergies. The planner would be fantastic to use if I could eat half of the food on there without MAJOR replacements that completely change the recipe. I'd give it 5 stars for that feature.",3,3,2020-03-28 22:17:48
"My bf and I have been using the app for about a week now and here's my suggestions so far: 1. Have an option to bookmark workouts, add them to ""favorites,"" or let users create lists. 2. The filter settings go a little wonky as you select multiple options. Even when you press"" clear"" to start over, the options don't reset. You have to exit the page and come back. 3. It'd be nice to filter workouts by time required 4. Customize weekly planner (""no equipment"" or a certain trainer for the week)",4,18,2020-04-03 20:24:48
"This is the best work out app and nutrition plan I have used. I feel better, have more energy and look forward to doing my work out. I love that there are options for different levels of difficulty and nutrition programs to match your end goals. The best feature is the shopping list. Add what your want for your meal plan and it adds all the ingredients to the shopping list.",5,1,2020-02-15 19:59:02
"Love all the workouts! You can choose your level; beginner, intermediate, or advanced. This is great to help you keep progressing. I also love the food. I haven't had one recipe that I haven't like yet! Overall. Highly recommend for anyone that's wanting to do at home workouts with minimal equipment!",5,1,2020-04-09 04:01:43
"It's a great app that really helped me actually drop a few pounds in quarantine. My one critique is the inconsistency in the formatting of the training videos (and occasional lack of explanation on how to do a given exercise), but on the whole it's a great workout/general wellness app",5,0,2020-06-04 04:43:10
"Great app that has made to easier for me to workout and cook. Love the recipes and variety of meals and workout options. I really wish it could link to food tracking apps like MyfitnessPal or something, so recipes can be exported. I've gained a couple pounds while on the weight loss track but without the ability to actually track my macros and calories on the Centr app itself, it's hard to know what's going wrong, even though nutrition information is provided on each recipe.",4,1,2020-02-28 18:00:09
"This app has great workouts and I have found the coached workouts are easy to follow. The recipes are fairly easy to follow and its improved my breakfast game. The reason it doesn't get five stars is because it's really lacking in personalization. It doesn't help you tract your weight or personalize the meal plan to your height/weight/gender/activity level. As is, the meal plan portion of the app is highly lacking for what you pay for the app. I do really love the workouts though.",4,4,2020-10-03 13:50:04
"Great app so far. I love the planner and being able to customize it to my needs (like when I'm going out or having leftovers for a meal). It would be awesome if I could add my current program to the planner, instead of going into the programs tab at the bottom to access my workout.",4,9,2022-12-06 23:09:25
"I hadn't used my app over the summer (busy with kids) and got logged out. Can't find my pw anywhere so tried to reset and didn't receive any emails. Tried emailing support and kept getting back that they're ""working on it"". It's been a week now and I still haven't heard back. It's unlikely they're going to make up for the time wasted on this. I've never experienced such lack of urgency/competency for such a simple issue from any company/business large or small. I definitely will not be renewing.",1,3,2023-09-25 16:25:27
"This app is amazing it's a full package, amazing recipes workouts, meditations (including ones for kids which is awesome). It's the approach to fitness and workouts which makes it different fun and friendly workouts and eating well with delicious recipes. Honestly I think this should be put on prescription for people it's the best excercise tool I've used",5,0,2023-09-05 16:04:22
Yes! Just stick with it a month and see if you like it. You gotta do it honestly. It works. Best workout app period! *Update: can not login to my account for 2 weeks. I am in week 17 of a 26 week program and I cannot access anything. Now I am not getting any response from customer svc... Update 2: issue resolved and received a free month.. they gave everyone workouts they could use after about 2-weeks of service interruption.. if this took 2-days i would give the 5th star back,4,2,2023-09-10 18:44:22
"Massive scam, avoid paying! Won't refund citing T&Cs, app won't open most of the time, when it does open you can't stay logged in long enough to do anything. If you pay for a service and you can't access the service, it is just theft. Look elsewhere.",1,2,2023-09-05 08:16:40
"App and programs are excellent. Customer support is the worst I've come across. Entire week without access, sent numerous emails no follow up or solution. In the end had to cancel my subscription and re join to get access.",3,3,2023-09-18 08:39:02
I'm still on the trial period. The programs and exercises seem really good to get fit. I can't find though a way to use the app when I'm offline.This would be really helpful for me because due to work I spent many days way off internet (gsm-landline) coverage.,3,2,2023-09-25 06:07:52
"Amazing! Love the trainers and the workouts. Would love to see a few more programs focusing on weight loss and overall body strenght as well as pilates/yoga/stretching rather than muscle gain, (it feels like all the programs lately are focusing on muscle gain), but other than that it's great!",5,1,2023-09-11 10:37:59
"Edit: they resolved the authentication issues so I can use the app I paid for again. however, I don't have much trust in a company who laid off key staff keeping the app running, so I won't be renewing my subscription unless their is more transparency from the new leadership.",4,2,2023-09-16 18:38:51
"The planner is a great way to get started, when like me you have no idea what you're doing. I noticed results within the first couple of months, losing weight and getting more defined. Now using the programs, i find it challenging and I'm definitely getting more muscle definition. Only gripe is occasionally some of the meals are not that great. That said you can mark your favourites and then swap out any that don't look great. Overall very much worth the subscription.",5,5,2023-07-27 05:56:13
"Had originally given it 5*. It has great workouts and their method has yielded great results for me. But as so many have said, it's been 3 weeks since both app and website have started crashing and I see no response from developers. Sure they'll reply emails and complaints but it makes no difference if the issue isn't fixed. Specially since you're paying for it. Sadly disappointed.",1,4,2023-08-28 15:01:57
"There were a few technical issues recently, that although they took some time to get fixed, they eventually did. Aside from that love the app so much, 2 years of using it",4,0,2023-09-07 09:38:15
"EDIT: the newest update keeps signing me out every time I navigate between tabs (says my session expired). Impossible to use the app. I have re-installed, deleted, etc. PLEASE FIX!!!! **************** GREAT programs, great recipes, great videos! Only improvement would be the cool down vids in the ignite program. They seem a little generic and don't always 100% relate to the groups worked in the exercises.",1,25,2023-08-24 16:47:18
I had so much confusion around building my workout and how to obtain my body goals. This app lays it all out for you with the ability to swap workouts that I'm not a fan of. Love this app.,5,0,2023-09-02 20:37:23
"Got an email saying redeem your credit, and all of a sudden I get a notification on a Saturday that a withdraw of 119 occured. Where's the credit? Where's the email stating y'all are charging? Haven't been able to get into the app and now this, on a Saturday evening?",2,3,2023-09-10 02:57:04
"This app has been my go to for over a year, but since my renewal came up, the app has been unusable. I keep being logged out and getting expired session error messages. Usually when you pay for a product or service, it's with the assumption you would receive access to said product or service. This feels like theft. I'm stranded without my meal planner, workout program and mediation library. What makes it worse is that there hasn't been much by way of communication from the Centr about a fix.",1,8,2023-08-26 14:00:15
"It's my second year using this app for working out. the programs are awesome, and the videos are easy to follow and convenient with many features for wellness. many of the workout movements in the programs are done even in gyms and best part is that it's not breaking the bank. with various levels from beginner, intermediate, and advanced, there's something for everyone. thank you for creating these functional, accessible and fun workouts that keep me healthy, especially with a busy life!",5,4,2023-07-17 00:34:24
"I was a complete novice at the types of intensive workout in this app but the clear supportive guidance has got me doing challenging dumbbell exercises in just a couple of weeks. There is an impressive array of options which gave me a sense of control and confidence, and although I haven't explored them as much yet, what looks to be a good range of supporting guidance on meditation and diet. Love it! It's a new part of my daily routine!",5,8,2023-05-22 06:00:13

I did the week free trial and absolutely love everything the program has to offer and was excited to continue my program. My card was charged and I assumed all was fine but now the app won't work and I'm in a continuous loop of the 'we dropped a Dumbbell' error message. try access anything else and I have to re log in. And back to dropping Dumbbell error. Same issue when I go on my pc and internet page on phone. tried uninstall/reinstall app no fix. So I've paid 1 year membership and no access.,2,3,2023-08-28 22:21:42
"Been with the app about a year, and while I don't use the recipes, I love that if I'm not doing a program, I can just use whatever the planner has set for me for the day's workout. Great coaches, video production, and workouts.",5,0,2023-09-06 18:05:01
"Amazing app, when it is working. Currently I can't sign on at all. It's too bad, I had just started the power program and was looking forward to it. I workout for my physical and mental health and when I don't have it, it affects me greatly. I hate to do this as I am sure centr is working hard to fix the problem. Ultimately though this is an expensive app and this is the second time it has completely crashed on top of the lagging and freezing that has been happening. I may have to move on.",2,3,2023-08-28 21:26:57
"Loved the app at first and would have rated it 5 stars for the fantastic programs and experienced trainers!! Second month in and the app keeps crashing, feeling annoyed that I've paid for a subscription I can't use..I've tried uninstalling to no avail. I've emailed but no response. I love the workouts, especially the 28 days of core as I am seeing positive changes, but can no longer log in. After reading through the reviews it seems this is a common occurrence. Please fix the issue 🙏",3,8,2023-08-28 07:10:16
"Some promising features that end up being executed poorly. Workouts for a start don't ever really feel massively challenging or backed by current science on the best way to train, surprising when Simon hill (one of the chefs) is part of the app and is all about science and health/fitness. Other points. Works terribly with a smartwatch, meals are either too sweet or bland, can't edit logbook after exercise. Have to say meditations are often good. Disappointed by this app and won't be renewing.",2,12,2023-05-29 11:45:59
"This is a fantastic app, everything you need for fitness and health. So many options to choose from workouts, recipes, trainers, meditations, etc. Love it. I've subscribed for several years. Just the interface has gone a bit clunky with the recent update - the headings have gone really bold and squashed up (android).",5,9,2023-06-08 05:51:52
Everything was perfect till this last update. Now it logs me out every time I try to start a program and it does it multiple times until I can finally get into one then at the end it'll log me out again before the program is done. I emailed support sent my issue I really hope they get it figured out cuz the app itself is awesome and I just want the bugs fixed.,4,1,2023-08-25 13:50:16
"Money grab. Was given a free subscription for a year, told them I didn't want it when it renewed (the same day) and they ignored me completely when I emailed them. I never used the app either, but am now stuck with a subscription I didn't want for another year. I'm not the only one this happened to, so be aware once you subscribe you will have a hard time unsubscribing. Would not recommend.",1,33,2023-06-17 06:12:24
"Enjoying the workouts. There are many targeted programs from which to choose. Watch out for Lexi's cooldowns, they are another workout. They have changed the app and it is not great at first use. No chance to provide feedback. Some workouts are a bit out of whack.",4,1,2023-07-28 06:24:58
All of a sudden the app has started timing out after logging in. Says the session has expired. I use this app nearly every day and it's incredibly frustrating to have paid as much as this is a year and not be able to access it. The website had no way to contact support or raise a question to help. I can't believe the product team hasn't rolled back. the latest update. makes no sense,1,8,2023-08-26 00:20:20
I like that I can get a solid workout in in my own home in a half hour. I wish there were more at home programs to follow and that the strength building program has more than one level.,4,0,2023-09-23 17:49:17

"I've been on the app for 6 weeks, after a 2yr hiatus from working out, and its truly transformed me. Im working out daily for the first time ever, can't recommend it enough. 2 weeks ago the app went down, and it upset a lot of people who probably loved the app up until that point. Hence, there are a ton of 1 star reviews over the last few weeks. Look past them! It's a shame this happened because the app is incredible and deserves a better score. I'm here to say that it's 100% working.",5,1,2023-09-01 21:15:08
"It was a good app until the last update. Now it is broken, constantly forcing you to relogin with a session timeout error. Because of this, none of the content is actually available. I had a year subscription and the app was broken for the last 56 days of my membership. I requested a refund for the last 56 days. Instead, they gave me a 30 day (not 56) coupon for my next membership, which is worthless since the app is still broken.",1,4,2023-08-27 17:42:09
Game changer. They have all workouts you need covered with and without equipment. Not to mention the other modalities and nutrition advice,5,0,2023-09-21 13:19:20
"The app hasn't been working for me for 3 days now, it keeps saying login expired and logs me out. Please fix this because I love this app! Absolutely love this app! Doing the programmes like centr6 really keep me motivated and keep me on track. The meals are delicious too in the vegan section with a good variety and the option to change a meal is good as I may not like the suggested meal on day so I swap it.",5,7,2023-08-12 10:45:27
I activated the monthly subscription with 7 day free trial and the app won't allow me to log in. It keeps stating I have to link subscription and then my session expired once I try to link. I've tried rebooting reinstalling nothing is working. now I'm going to be charged the monthly fee on an app I can't even open. it won't allow me to cancel the subscription in my Google play because I need to go into the app that won't let me in!!!!!!,1,7,2023-08-24 12:39:24
Best workouts I've ever had. I'm definitely happy with seeing real results. The coaches are all amazing! Very motivating and super easy to follow and use. I love the recipes and meditation. It's made a huge impact all the way around. Thanks to Chris Hemsworth and his entire team!! Get this app is worth every second.,5,0,2023-08-15 13:01:19
"I really enjoy this app. Being able to select what equipment I have and this filter out the workouts that use only my equipment is awesome! The workouts are great also, being able to select how long of a workout and what muscle groups to hit makes things easy and great. I don't use the recipes much but it is a really cool thing to have and it's convienient that the app will make you shopping lists. I got a year sub. free when I bought my cable machine and will be renewing my subscription.",5,1,2023-08-13 13:22:23
"This app is just okay. The Good: - Nice interface - Nice variety of workouts - Lots of info on diet The Bad: - WearOS app. New watch app but still cant log weight on it. It's hard to log sets and weights going back and forth to your phone. It would be better if logging and rest timer would be on your watch. - Doesn't sync workouts with Samsung Fitness - When browsing meals, if you go into a recipe and then back out, the list of meals starts from the beginning again. - iPad app is shrunk.",2,15,2023-06-03 21:00:14
"Veriaty is good. However, there are so many different workouts to choose from, I didn't know where to start. The app didn't really get me motivated, so I lost interest. I then forgot about the app, didn't receive any notification of the subscription renewal until the payment of £93 came out of my bank account, leaving me in my overdraft. Contacted customer service in a panic & got a standard 'not our problem' response. Would not rate this app or customer service received. Very disappointed.",1,17,2023-06-21 08:00:56
"I love this app. Following the meal plan they set up for me (part of the app features) has led to my clothes that used to fit well fitting loosely. I'm not sure if I've lost weight, but I have lost size. Just from eating better without the hassle of finding healthy recipes. Centr already did the work. Add to that the fact that there's exercise programs I can follow w/ a coach or solo and DELICIOUS homemade snack options, the $120 for a year membership has paid for itself in less than 6 months.",5,5,2023-05-14 20:32:49
"Changing my review as frustration mounts. The app now asks to log back in every few seconds or so... After multiple attempts and precious time wasted, it may or may not work. The wow factor of the app diminishes greatly when going through such a customer experience. I've been using Centr religiously for almost 2 years and showing it off to friends and family, but this needs to get fixed asap please.",1,13,2023-08-25 21:59:01
"Pros: great content and programs when working. Cons: poor tech support and poor corporate communication when not working. 5 months into a year subscription and overall has been a 4/5 experience. As it gets closer renewal I'll have to assess how the rest of the year subscription goes. Prior to the August 2023 3 week outage, this was a 5/5 experience.",4,6,2023-08-30 17:20:26
"I absolutely love this app. It gives me motivation, challenges me and I can record my progression which I love. Unfortunately, today, however, I can't gain access to the app and now feel like I've lost a limb, as I can't get into anything. I have a busy job (like most people who buy fitness apps, as they don't want to plan workouts every day!) And now I'm having to think of workouts to do 😑🙈 Please update the app and fix this issue team!",5,0,2023-08-28 11:40:52
"I signed up for the trial and didn't like the lack of flexibility of adjusting my days of training, duration or other parameters. So, I decided to cancel the subscription, and I was late by only few days to cancel. They wouldn't refund a year worth of subscription even though I only used it once or twice. The worst app and customer service ever. Don't use it, there are better alternatives out there. All those people that have reviewed it are being paid a commission to do that .",1,8,2023-06-28 21:19:34
"I absolutely love this app but have no idea what is currently happening. You login, it loads and then kicks you straight out. This app is 100% unusable and what makes it worse is I am paying for this. The response to this problem has been minimal, and it has been occurring for a long time. It may be, if bot fixed, what makes me move away from this app even though it is extremely useful.",1,3,2023-08-27 13:25:26
"Update: Ive used this app for almost 2 years and have loved it and had no problems with it. Until this week. It now wont open the programs and signs me out. Its unusable in its current state. Centr, please fix this!!! Centr has been a real tool for changing my body composition. It has been a perfect introduction into weight training from someone who had no experience. My body is leaner and stronger and I really appreciate all of the encouragement and guidance with training and food consumption.",1,5,2023-08-24 16:09:36
"The app is fine. BUT BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU PURCHASE AS THEY HAVE A SNEAKY STRICT REFUND POLICY! I was pumped on the app during the week trial so I decided to do the 1 year subscription. Then after 10 days I had a look through the rest of the courses and decided that actually the app doesn't quite fit with my long term goals. I asked to be downgraded to the monthly plan & only refunded the difference, which I don't think should be a hard ask. THEY REFUSED! Very disappointed in this company",1,3,2023-07-17 21:31:52
"The app was relatively good and I have subscribed for a year however, for some reason now there is a prompt saying "" your session has expired.

"Have had this app for some time and absolutely love it but the last four plus days it has logged me out and cannot log back in, same problem as many it seems. I am halfway through a program, had a long weekend off and had planned to get at least another four workouts in as I had the time, but that plan has failed due to the app. Please fix. People plan their busy lives around these workouts and being down for four plus days is not acceptable.",1,13,2023-08-14 10:25:40

"The content is great and I applaud the creators of the content, one of the best fitness products on the market. My issue however is with the developers of the app who have taken months ,and still counting, to fix login issues. Essentially the app continues to kick you out and several outages have been reported. I have reported this to Centr on multiple occasions asking them for a root cause analysis and resolution and they are not able to provide an answer. Hire good developers please!",1,3,2023-08-25 10:27:20

Doesn't work. App constantly logs me out. What's going on in the past couple weeks?? Edit: 08/28 - they gave everyone a free month. That's cool but a free month of a app that does not work is fairly useless. Still not fixed and seems to be even worse,1,7,2023-08-28 09:30:56
"******I am so disappointed the app is literally not useable right now and has been like this for days. It won't stay logged in no matter what.

I did 5 complete programs then I started to do the daily workouts about a month ago, which appear to workout all muscle groups pretty well.",1,3,2023-08-28 06:07:54
"Was quite good other than logbook is difficult to use. Now it continually logs me out and forces me to log in repeatedly to access programs (or locks me out entirely) which makes a paid subscription a complete waste of money.

My daughter suggested Centr; I love this app. The Planner has given me SO MUCH MOTIVATION! I don't have to search for what workout to do each day; it's right there waiting for me each morning on the app. You don't have to use the planned workout, you can choose another workout like yoga! Great app and SO worth the cost paying yearly! I have even gotten on my bike again for warmup.",5,0,2023-08-09 17:19:09

Also troubling is the publisher's response to the many negative reviews here offering constructive feedback - a stock message saying ""glad you are enjoying the app"". Is anyone actually reading and responding to this issue? Very disappointing, if it's not fixed soon I'll be canceling my sub.",1,2,2023-08-27 16:12:11

But I manage, there's so much to choose from. Biggest complaint, where's Thor?!! Thought he'd do a workout or something lol!",4,0,2023-08-18 19:33:35
"Content good, utility not so much. When using the app the workouts constantly freeze which makes getting into it really difficult, you just get your heartrate up and it pauses and leaves you hanging. There is no issue with my Internet and other apps I use don't do this so it is definitely a Centr problem and is really disappointing.",3,3,2023-05-24 10:22:37
"Love this app so much! I've been using this app for a couple of years already, and I don't have anything negative to say about it. Of course, it takes dedication to work towards your goals, but this app makes it easier (for me). I love the assortment of workout programs plus meals. They are so diverse, so you can take your pick... Literally. I don't have much home-equipment, so I love that they have programs that don't require any equipment as well. Highly highly highly recommend this app!",5,0,2023-06-12 21:43:44
"I tried a free trial for this app because of Chris Hemsworth and how he looked in Thor. This app is so much more than I imagined and I feel inspired every day to keep going. I have had quite a few setbacks since I joined, but I can't imagine life without this app. There are various programs, planner workouts, meals, meditations, information blogs. It really has it all. I sampled other apps, but Centr for me is the one I'll keep going back to, it's just superb.",5,0,2023-05-13 08:37:47
I do love this app. The flexibility to swap workouts and meals is awesome. I love that it plans everything out for you including a shopping list. The only thing I wish it has was the ability to put in food allergies to avoid recipes that's contain them.,4,0,2023-05-22 17:52:19

"I use this exclusively for the workout programs. I love the variety and they keep adding new ones. They are easy to follow + I've shaved a few pounds and noticeably toned up after my first 6 weeks. If you're struggling to get back into a routine and don't really want to go to a gym, I highly recommend this! Definitely worth the $.",5,0,2023-05-16 22:15:02
"I have been a user over the last 18 months. The workouts, recipes, and meditations are great. Many options are available. Unfortunately, over the last three weeks, many users have had no access to the app or through the website. Little to no solutions have been offered. I recently received an email saying I will get a credit for a month. What's the use of it if I can't access the app or website.",1,6,2023-08-27 06:10:56
I've enjoyed the app for almost a year now without issue. However the latest update keeps signing me out and the app is essentially bricked at this point. I can no longer access and workout or meal without being logged out prior to reaching it.,3,3,2023-08-22 20:33:50

Amazing holistic approach to fitness and wellness. Works well with a tight schedule and addresses both physical as well as nutritional and emotional health. Totally recommend the app!,5,1,2023-05-18 20:08:10
"Update: This was a 5 star app for the past 3 years.

It's definitely the best online exercise programs iv tried. Very easy to stay motivated and it makes you not want to miss a day. Only feed back would be to be able to record(write down) your own workout and diet. If I miss a day doing centaur because I went gym hiking or biking it would be nice to look at the calender and not look like a lazy day.,5,0,2023-05-25 22:01:41

"As workout apps go, this is by far my favourite. Very approachable with plenty of modifications to up the intensity of the workouts depending on your goals. Tasty food, and bonus yoga that tests your core. Worth the price, but I'd recommend the annual payment.",5,0,2023-05-02 15:52:43
"Great, motivating, varied. I love that I can do a program, try something that they recommend daily, or seek out my favourite trainer.

Becareful if you wish to cancel subscription. If not done exactly as they expect they blame you. Cancelled via Google play months in advance and they said it didn't count as it wasn't through the website. No subscription reminders or receipts. Be vigilant with fraud.,1,2,2023-08-27 13:48:18

"Absolutely love this app. Has helped my wife and I get into fitness with beginners training regimes that go up to moderate and advanced. Lots of meal recommendations, guest work outs like Da Rulk's and a planner. Recommended to anyone looking to get fit.

"First the bad: sometimes the app/website just doesn't work at all. For a paid subscription service, this is very disappointing. Based on this fact alone, I would give the app 1 star - except that when it is working (which is most of the time) it is a really good service. The app design could be better, but the workouts, recipes, and meditations are all top tier and more than make up for any flaws. I have noticed more progress in my fitness by following this app than anything else I have tried.",4,7,2023-08-13 21:29:00
"Love that you can set your meal preference so I only get vegetarian recipes sent to me. Love the complete system with the meal plans, exercise and meditation portions. Some workouts seem to repeat too frequently while others offer a variety of new moves. Lastly, if the subscription cost could be reduced, that would be amazing. Overall, I am very happy with the app.",4,23,2020-05-16 14:36:41
"The app is fantastic. Workouts are easy to follow, as challenging as you need them to be and keep you coming back for more! The meal plans are great, delicious recipes and simple to cook. However, the app (and the website) keep having problems with crashing/not logging in at random - this seems to happen every other day and can last for over an hour before being fixed! This is extremely frustrating if you're in the middle of a workout or cooking!",4,24,2020-01-22 19:02:19
"Could easily be brilliant with a few tweaks. The videos don't always load properly during workouts, and the search function could do with some improvements. If you specify arms and back in your search, for example, it gives every workout that has either of those muscle groups, rather than those with both. As well, rather than searching for arms, it would be nice if you could search bicep or tricep specifically. Overall very good and helpful, but could be improved upon with a few simple changes",3,35,2021-02-11 20:42:27
Loved the app. Eventhough it's slightly expensive as compared to other apps. It's still worth it. Exercises are very challenging and pushes you hard. The only drawback I would like to state here is that there are very less modifications for some advanced moves. And very less range of stretching exercises. They are very repetitive. Rest is good. Have been doing it for 3 weeks now. Never felt so good.,4,163,2021-01-08 14:03:52
"I've wanted to use this app since it was first launched but hadn't had the funds before now. When I took advantage of the six week trial in March 2020 I was not surprised to find it superb and well thought out. The ability to focus on weight loss, strength, or fitness and the way it shapes your daily planned workouts and meals is intuitive, and the intensity can be changed at any time. I just took on my first programme Unleashed, and I'm looking forward to seeing the impact. Highly recommended.",5,2,2020-05-19 12:44:09
"There is a big range of workouts to do plus stretching and even food plans and relaxation tasks. It's a great app. The only thing that can be improved is in their programs. The pre and post stretches are the same each day in the challenge so far . I'm in week 2. Not a major issue, I do whatever stretches I think I need and more targeted to what the work out was. I would definitely recommend this app. Especially you if you travel you can always pick some work outs without weights",4,2,2020-06-01 21:37:14
"This is an awesome fitness programme, adapted to all fitness levels and with a whole range of options in the goals you wish to attain. The programme is adapted to your fitness level, goal and diet (vegan, vegetarian, lactose intolerant,...). There are also a lot of different instructor, which is really nice. You have wonderful meditations included as well, and if you don't want to follow the fixed programme you're free to choose your workout. The apps works perfectly as well. Thumbs up.",5,7,2020-04-22 15:19:15
"Freaking amazing!, The workouts are great, the planner is really good! The food choices are amazing. The only few downsides is: 1. No off-line download, that would be great 2. No way to make favorite workouts But that is minor compared to what you get, you get an amazing list of options to workout and eat! This is one of the best fitness apps I have tried that has everything for an affordable price!",5,20,2020-04-10 08:58:18
"I'll go straight to the problems (but give 5 stars because I'm a developer too and I understand that it is not possible to release a perfect app, and despite the problems - I enjoyed it): 1) Explanation videos don't block the screen. I was watching Da Rulk's basic explanations and my screen turned off in the middle of the video. I must point out that workout videos were working fine the whole session. 2) Metric and Imperial systems are often mixed. For example here: Panzanella Salad with Bocconcini - 2 thick (2 1/2 oz) slices sourdough bread (or gluten free) cut into 1 inch cubes - 2 1⁄3 cups (70g) mixed lettuce leaves I have metric system selected and I have no idea what are 1 inch cubes. In the same recipe: Preheat oven to 390°F and line a baking sheet with baking paper. Again, I have no idea what is that temperature. In one of the videos someone mentioned that the weight should be 1-2 kgs (I think it was ""how can I replace everything with dumbbells"" video). Now I imagine that USA population would be confused with that phrase. 3) Video turns off and screen scrolls up if I decide to change phone positioning from vertical to horizontal. Overall video is not very comfortable to watch if I want to review the videos before starting a workout, because I can't just open them fixed fullscreen and there is a big yellow button on the way. 4) There is no intuitive way to review the basics of an exercise. Yesterday I did a workout, but I couldn't find a way to see the details of how each exercise should be done. I had to kinda just observe and repeat what was on the video. I think there must be a helpful link somewhere in the recommended articles in the beginning, but I think it would be way more comfortable to have it inside of workout, so I would be able to just click and see how to do the exercise properly anytime. 5) More local adjusted recipes. I don't have maple syrup. Maples don't grow in Brazil (maybe they do, but I haven't see one). In another hand I have access to a variety of amazing tropical fruits and vegetables - and I want to take advantage of that. Related to the same problem - there is no turkey here! I wish I would be able to buy it (and there are so many recipes with it), but there is none. I'm glad there is that switching option, but I imagine it won't solve all the problems.",5,61,2019-12-17 13:58:07
"I really like the app and love the recipes. I like that Centr 6 program has 3 difficulties in 1 video. But it still needs improvement! If you're training every day, the music gets super repetitive! No favorites and you don't have an overview of when you trained or cooked something. It is important for me to track my progress and would be great to make my own planner (choose the trainings and meals you wanna do each day). Other free apps have more to offer for the moment. Personalize!!!!",3,26,2020-04-05 21:35:06
"Beautifully presented app, easy to navigate and a wide selection of exercises. The plans generated on the planner mix up the type of exercises each day, resulting in varied routines. If you want to mix up what is suggested there is a vast library for all abilities. Lots of awesome recipes, after switching to a vegetarian diet I was pleasantly surprised with the huge choice of meals. One improvement would be a favourites list to make it easier to find the users preferred dishes.",5,12,2020-04-21 23:45:52
"Would not recommend this for beginners. Unless you have some prior knowledge of fitness and nutrition, it is quite difficult to follow. There are a lot of different programs to chose, which is confusing. I found the workouts difficult to follow on a tablet / phone and end up getting frustrated and not even bothering. Recipies look great, if you can find ingredients. Not exactly regular supermarket stuff for a lot of it, perhaps the programs are more designed around inner city folks.",2,35,2021-02-06 06:35:54
"Love it (mostly). I love the workout, I love the meals and I love the supportive community. It definitely lacks some features though. The main thing is a means to track your lifts in the Build Muscle program. As progressive overload is integral to building muscle, you need to know exactly what you have lifted previously. And while I could use another app, or a pen and paper, something in the app would be better. I would also like a way to track progress - weight loss, progress pics etc.",4,70,2021-03-09 22:29:27
"Imho a real cool app, but I still won't continue to use it. Especially the meditations are great. Its missing customization options, for example ""show only workouts without equipment"" or filter out recipes by ingredients. The recipes are great, but shopping the ingredients for a whole week takes an insane amount of time and you will have a lot of ingredients left over. Too expensive for me, but I still think it's a cool app. I would pay for an app that is just the meditation stuff.",4,30,2021-05-27 18:38:05
"Overall Centr is brilliant! meals can be a little pricey & time consuming, however you do get the option to swap the meal. I think an option to copy a day's meal to the whole week would be beneficial, as regards to changing the meals day by day, meal by meal. The only downside for me is selecting workouts on the filter feature, not a problem just slightly annoying. For example you can select no equipment and it may give you a workout with dumbbells. App is better with equipment! Worth the money.",4,2,2020-04-07 08:29:08
"This is my first review of any app. But for anyone looking to find app to keep you focused on your goals, accountable and easy to use. It really is great. You don't get overwhelmed by the number of coaches or the ""build your own workout"" and once you find a coach you like and chose to follow them, it becomes even easier. also, the workout is predetermined for each day, no time wasted filtering through (if you don't want to). The the helpful meals, mindset and articles are an absolute bonus.",5,2,2021-03-12 02:19:04
"Totally worth it. The recipes are great, sometimes the portions seem a bit large though. The coaches are amazing and they each have different personalities that allows you to choose the perfect workout for your mood/energy. The sleep visualisations are great, at least, the first half - couldn't tell you how any of them finish haha but the best part is the community, what a great collection of people.",5,1,2021-01-23 19:35:00
"One of the best fitness App on the market. Overall it's very complete. However, it would be great to have diversified pre-designed programs (over many weeks) that are not only focused on HIIT or similar programs. For example, including yoga or pilates, or mindfulness programs to add to the existing list offered on the App. Other than that, this is a good app.",4,78,2020-11-08 12:00:05
"Easy to follow workouts, plans and recipes that are all wrapped up in a great user experience. I've tried many other fitness apps in the past but this is by far the easiest to use and the one I have no problem coming back to every day. I used it free for 6 weeks but knew pretty quickly that I would become a paying customer. I'd like to see some more kettlebell focused routines but other than that ita difficult to fault the content.",5,0,2020-05-18 21:48:06
"Fantastic app I'm easily bored and this is one of the few exercise apps that I've stuck with. It's the complete package. Variety of exercises, food plan and meditation. The app is geared to you, your fitness level, what you want to get out of it whether it be weight loss/gain, tone, etc. and you can change your preferences at any time. It also has a Facebook group that gives you the extras, a sounding board, help and a place to post your progress. It's a group of positivity.",5,8,2020-07-15 14:59:52
"I love most of the things about this app, the workouts are great and varied and I like how the centr six program allows you to challenge yourself by leveling up in the one workout. I would like to be able to turn off the music in the workout so I can play my own music without it clashing and still be able to hear the instructions from the trainers.",4,56,2020-09-16 03:10:46
"Love this app. Very versatile and not much equipment is needed. Instructions are clear and easy to follow so working out with the video clips is easy. Offers programs as well as individual work outs. Also offers dietary tips and recipes if you want to go all in. Only thing I would like to change is a variation to the cool down stretches in the programs as they are the same every day. However, there are stretch workouts available to but for speed and ease a variation would be good.",4,2,2020-12-07 13:26:26
"I love this app! It is well laid out and easy to use. I also love the program. There are so many options to choose from, and so far I have really enjoyed all the trainers/teachers. My favorites are the yoga and MMA, and I've really enjoyed trying different kinds of moves, like kicking and punching. The meal plans look amazing, although I've only tried a few recipes; I can imagine how following it to a ""t"" would make meals easier and likely save money on groceries too! I've fully subscribed!",5,2,2020-05-22 22:42:52
"Great app with a lot of good content. A few things that could be improved - recommendations on weight (as % of 1 rep max). Also, some of the exercise program's progressions are too steep. The current program I'm doing for example does 3 weeks of 7x3 chin-ups, then immediately jumps to 10x4.. and then in other parts of the same program the exercises are too easy. It would also be better if the rest timers ran while the screen is locked. But all in all a very good app.",4,24,2021-09-04 23:32:39
"The app itself is quite good actually, even excellent I'd say and I encourage its use. However, the one star goes to their hardline billing conditions, as though as it is set in stone. If you make an accidental purchase, or if you forgot to cancel your subscription before the trial ends, then there's no refund whatsover. This is not how you win customers, this is how you push them away. Now that I'm stuck with a subscription I no longer need, I'm definitely not renewing at the end of it.",1,343,2020-12-26 00:26:26
"This APP is hands down THE best health/fitness app I've used. It has everything I could possibly want to ensure a holistic approach to fitness, health and well-being. The workouts are easy to follow and tailored for home or gym settings. I LOVE it! I love the added save feature to find my favourite work outs. The only suggestion I would make is the addition of a function which allows me to see which workouts I have completed (a simple tick box or similar) so I can see which ones I have done.",5,19,2020-07-24 00:10:20
"Excellent app. Well encompassing all round. Training regime is well put together and meals + grocery list are very useful. Only issue is that when I switch apps to go change my music or lock my phone screen W/ centr in the background, the app resets the workout to the beginning that I am doing on the android. This did not happen on my iPhone which is something to look into. Keep up the great work!",5,0,2020-06-16 14:21:42
"From beginner to pro, I definitely recommend trying Centr ! I've surprised myself with how much I enjoy it. I love the pilates and meditation especially. Everyone is bound to find something they want to try. Visually, it is shot beautifully. It is not intimating like other apps I have tried, it encourages movement and health, not the 'dream' body, and that's what drew me to the app. I prefer to utilise trainer in workouts and constantly impressed by how clearly they explain each exercise.",5,7,2020-06-11 00:03:09
"Firstly, the content on Centr is clearly 5/5 stars. The workouts are great, well constructed, and diverse for whatever your goals are. However, there are a few simple quality of life problems that I just can't believe exist in what is otherwise an exemplary app. I don't know if this is only on the Android version, but the fact that I need to start from 0 and manually scroll to the weight I am using without an option to simply type in a number is just silly. Additionally, the logbook shows your last three Weight/reps, but they are logged upside down which is unnecessarily confusing. I also wish that the self-guided workouts could continue running when the app is not the active screen. If I have a 90 second rest phase, I can often send out a quick email in that time, but then the rest timer freezes when I navigate away from the app. Other fitness apps overlay a timer so that this is not an issue. Despite these small quibbles, I really do think the app is entirely worth the subscription. I will gladly up my rating to 5 stars if there is intention to at least consider fixing some of these issues.",3,42,2022-03-11 18:19:16
"Was really looking forward to using this app, it seemed to tick all the right boxes. Unfortunately it didn't live up to expectations. I personally wanted the app to do all the planning work for me and it does to a point but was constantly swapping out workouts and recipes due to lack of equipment for the workout or ingredients that I don't like. You can't set a permanent filter for your preferences!? The workouts I did do were good but the recipes are complex and cost £££!",1,22,2020-06-12 14:59:25
"The content is very high quality and a life changer, nothing less. It's great that you can browse through all of it at any time. The recipes are great, although favorites would be nice. The app is quite well done and easy to use. Very engaging and beautiful. Screen rotation during workout video playback is not as stable as it could be, though. And yeah, some sort of offline cache would be cool.",4,2,2020-05-20 05:12:33
"Absolutely brilliant takes all the thinking out of it. I was very unmotivated before this app and could never commit or get it right, but now am totally focused and addicted. You put your goal in and it does the rest for you for every day of the week -meal plans, exercise, meditation, the works. Well worth the subscription for the life transformation and well being. I should also mention there is something for everyone, so many different trainers you can use a different person every day. I LOVE",5,7,2021-02-21 09:30:23
"Great app overall but could use a few adjustments. I'd much rather have an actual calender in app that you can look at with a checkmark on every day you completed a workout. Also, when doing a workout, I'd love to see an option to do a tutorial on each workout to make sure you're doing it correctly as your going; Because it's rather annoying to have to quit out of your workout midway through , to go look at a how to tutorial. Other than that, great app. I've been getting in much better shape!",4,56,2021-10-15 03:45:19
"Great app with lots of exercises. Would be great to have a search feature where you can filter by the latest exercises. There should be a section for ""what's new"". Please also create more programs with some more variety! I find myself starting to get bored after week 4. Overall, great app with lots of potential to be amazing!",4,0,2020-05-22 22:55:06
"A great app! Easy to use and extremely intuitive. Equipped with plenty of workouts that range in intensity. A plethora of dietary and nutritional meal plans to compliment your goals. I'd love to see some sort of goal tracking system though; a way to see how much weight you've gained or lost depending on your goals. I believe this would coincide with Centr nicely as it'd be a form of positive encouragement. Overall, a well polished - well oiled app.",5,3,2020-06-21 06:40:10
"Very good app with a massive variety of workouts for different preferences and equipment. The coached workouts are really good, and I seldom workout without following one. There is a meal plan feature, which I find myself using to find new healthy and simple recipes, however I don't follow the plan regularly. There is also a grocery list function which doesn't work amazingly, as you cannot easily export this to a list to paste elsewhere. I don't want my groceries in this app only.",5,6,2022-08-28 11:56:25
"Great app. Some minor improvements needed. App is very sensitive since last major update to switching between landscape and portrait mode on videos, I have to lock my screen mode to prevent it. Also, doesn't have a feature to download the workout so it consumes a lot of data, like Gigs of data a month, even if you avoid the guided workouts or disable the video in favour of just an image. Otherwise love the app, used it solid for nearly 6 months",3,1,2020-04-08 20:02:57
Just signed up to the app today and completed my first session.. It was short but very intense and I enjoyed the coach session.. I also completed to bonus round self guided session.. While I very much enjoyed the interface and options available I think a few more things could be adjusted for a better experience. 1. Have the ability as a user to turn off the music in the app in order to play your own music I have more recommendations but not enough space. Can I contact the developers?,4,20,2020-09-28 08:13:55
"This is one of the best and most value for money all-round physical well-being apps I've found, depending on your subscription option. The trainers and chefs are varied, motivating and challenging, and they engage with you on social media if you have any questions. I would like more vegetarian recipe options, because although there are loads of them, some of them are quite similar. I love that there are different goal settings, and the shopping list is a great feature.",5,32,2022-04-29 09:49:41
6 months in and I'm very impressed with the co tent and the app. My main phone is an iPhone the iPhone version doesn't allow casting to Chromecast(annoyingly). Having used both iOS and Android versions I can honestly say there's only one way iOS is better than the Android version is that when swapping a workout the iOS UI is much nicer and easier to navigate with the filter on the top rather than the sliding side menu. Otherwise excellent app 👍,5,2,2020-04-13 04:34:26
The only thing app that actually changed my life. And the only review I have ever written or will write again!!!!,5,0,2023-09-15 03:17:56
Incredible variety of workouts that makes you want to keep coming back for more. Perfect app for a home gym and incredible meal plans. Highly recommend!,5,0,2023-06-24 23:13:37
"Tons of workouts! They have a ton of options for workouts with varying equipment and difficulty so there's enough to cover everyone's experience and needs! Plus, tons of diet tips and recipes! 10/10 recommend! Any day now and I will look like Vin Diseal!",5,0,2023-06-12 01:08:55
"I am a total beginner, and some beginner excercises are too advanced for me (not many though), and i just modify. Not a gym person, but I love the variations in the app. Montlhy rates are high, so i opted for the year subscription after a 7 day free trail, which is a good deal. All in all, good to get started.",5,1,2020-05-21 07:53:00
"Currently utilising the 6 weeks free that were generously offered in view of the global lockdown. I have to say I am very impressed with the app and it's comprehensive approach to wellness, workouts and diet. The content is broad and easily navigated and there are a variety of excellent workouts to choose from which are high intensity and require minimal equipment. The only drawback is the high monthly subscription cost, perhaps a reduced cost option to access only workouts would be viable?",5,6,2020-04-17 15:40:12
"Life changing, but needs profiles. I use every aspect of the centr app and have found it is consistent and definitely has helped me improve my health. An improvement I'd like to see is profiles like Netflix. At the moment it is set up for me, which means the meal plans and workouts are catered to my needs. But often my wife would like to make use of it. She can do my workouts or we can select manually but it doesn't have the same feel as ticking them off.",5,18,2021-09-02 01:27:58
"This is truly a remarkable app. It has everything I need to maintain my well being when it comes to exercise, nutrition and overall tips for a healthy lifestyle. No matter the circumstances or equipment (lack thereof) you can find a session that fits them. Especially now, with the present situation we're facing globally, this app has come in handy to keep offer options to keep going with my fitness goals. Totally recommended. Have to mention that the team behind it and coaches are good fun! :)",5,10,2020-04-14 04:10:12
"I tried the app after hearing about the free trial like a lot of people. It's an amazingly detailed program that takes a holistic approach to body and mind. It requires commitment, but once you're familiar with it all this will become a little less time consuming. I chose to delete it due to not having time to commit to this approach yet, and it couldn't have been easier. No surprise charges, no complications. When circumstances change I'll be picking this up again. Would recommend easily.",5,5,2020-05-15 12:26:50
"Love it!! Love the programs, the planner, the info, the Facebook community group. Love it all. Highly recommend. Recipes could be improved to make it practicle for real people and real life...no one eats 1/8 avocado and then what?! Too much wastage and too expensive to follow. The videos crash quite a lot and it's frustrating eniugh when you want to do a work and just plain disappointing and irritating when it happens during the workout.",4,4,2020-05-29 09:12:14
All-around excellence. Food options alone are worth more than the annual fee. Bonus after bonus with the ever growing training programs.,5,0,2023-06-02 06:06:51
Used the app for the past 3 months and the quality and variety of the training sessions is generally very good. I haven't used the meal planning parts of the app as I don't need it. The yoga sessions are great but more variety here would be good - sessions with more chill music for example. A 'Favourites' feature would be a great addition.,4,5,2020-07-08 06:27:45
"Almost perfect. The workouts and programs are great. Although once I embarrassed myself in the gym when I couldn't stop laughing because during a serious, coached workout, it suddenly screamed in my ear:""DONUTS!!! RUN FOR THOSE DONUTS!!"" and i lost it. The only thing I would love to add is to be able to record runs (just distance and time) so they come up when I look at my workout history.",5,16,2022-08-10 04:27:04
Best fitness health and well being app on the market.,5,0,2023-09-26 14:27:19
"Very comprehensive, with an excellent range of challenging workouts for those ranging from beginner to intermediate. The meal plans are straightforward, nutritious (and delicious) and Centr's other supplementary materials such as meditations means that you have a balanced range of activities to choose from. Especially good for people like me who need more structure and variety to stay interested.",5,2,2020-07-16 07:01:23
"Great app with a great assortment of programming by awesome trainers, regardless of the workout I always feel leaving with a sense of accomplishment. The only thing i would improve is the logbook function, it is a little cumbersome to use and so really haven't taken advantage of the function which means I don't know what improvement could be made to it either. But overall I'm really enjoying it",4,15,2022-08-29 09:53:41
"Loads of workouts and recipes to suit almost every need! The content focusing on mindfulness and meditation are really useful too and have had a very positive impact on me. Only changes could be being able to customise individual workouts to swap in/out certain exercises (e.g. low impact to work around a specific issue, or an alternative if you don't have access to specific equipment) and to add snacks into the planner like other meals, but even then that's all easy enough to work around.",5,10,2020-08-15 17:42:04
"Fantastic way to stay motivated! ... The app is pretty comprehensive, helping with both coached & self managed workouts, as well as healthy diet, and mental health using affirmations and meditation. ... For me personally, every single recipe I've tried so far has been delicious! I've had so much fun prepping my meal (which is usually the worst part of getting your health back on track) ... Would totally recommend if you've struggled to stay motivated, or stick to your new year's/resolution.",5,10,2021-03-05 02:38:36
"Been signed up for about 3 months now, apps really good, plenty of workouts and I'm definitely seeing benefits. I know there's a lot of talk about it taking over your life but I've found it easy to balance between following it in full and making my own decisions. It would be nice if it was a bit more customisable, maybe for specific sports and training plus also I don't remember putting in any body metrics (height, weight, size, etc.) So does fill a bit one size fits all.",4,7,2021-04-28 09:05:56
"Been using this app for quite awhile and love it! Might just be Samsung, but there are a couple things that are slightly annoying. If I do a self-guided workout, I have the option to adjust my logbook, but can't do anything if it is coached. Also with the logbook, weights have to be scrolled to. Not a big deal for most exercises, but if I'm squatting or doing leg press, etc, it takes awhile to scroll to the 400+ range, and a typing option would be optimal. Otherwise, love everything else!",4,20,2022-03-14 19:45:08
"This app had been a fitness game changer for me The ability to choose different workout types, then pick beginner to advanced depending on your ability keeps me interested and enthused. Workouts are structured so they can be done at home with little to no equipment required. The meals are all easy to make, with ingredients that people actually shop for, and can buy at the supermarket.",5,2,2020-02-16 11:08:04
"Good coached exercises, recipes are really nice for what I have tried so far and I never used to use meditation or sound scapes for sleeping but I have found they are really good. Excellent value for money as well when paid for the whole year!",5,0,2023-06-28 16:35:37
"I have multiple issues with the app mainly around customer service & app features and controls. The content of the app is vast which initially seemed like a good thing. However the app is really clunky. If you enroll on a programme, it doesn't auto add to your daily planner in-app meaning you have to search for it every time. The app says that stretching sessions are linked to each workout - they aren't and it's unclear where to find them. There's so many issues by I only have 500 characters.",1,27,2023-01-07 13:04:10
"Training and meals are great, but the app has lots of room for improvement. The app can be overwhelming. Doesn't feel personalized. The meals are very good, however the way it works on the planner is madness if you are really are doing a weekly shop to buy all groceries. Changing a training session on the planner or even changing the training day shouldn't be a hassle. It is perfect if you have the life of a superstar, not so suitable for the common Joe.",3,3,2022-11-26 02:12:42
"Usually a great app. Can't access the ""Programs"" menu today. it just says ""Your session expired"" and then I have to login again.",1,3,2023-08-23 18:08:58
"The workouts and programs are very good and I enjoyed doing them. The meals seemed repetitive unless you swap out each one on the day. The breakfasts alternate between 2 or 3 per week and there is a 'leftovers' for lunch in the meal plan. Some of the breakfasts require you to prep for 4hrs or so, and there is no choice to filter out allergies, if you cannot eat Soya then you are out of luck because there is a lot of Tofu. I wasn't too impressed with the food but everything else is very good.",3,24,2022-07-20 17:18:35

Honestly best fitness app I have ever tried. The exercises accommodate all fitness levels. If you aren't able to do an exercise just do the modified version. It is easy to track your progress and access the program at any point. I have never been able to stick to a certain diet but the food plan Centr has on a weekly basis is fantastic and don't get me started on their snacks!!,5,34,2020-10-21 03:01:17

After immediately contacting the customer service and informing them I had canceled, they sent back a canned response saying pretty much they don't offer refunds for any reason. They claim these billing terms are clearly visible, but they certainly weren't when I last used the service 6 months ago. It looks like there have been many similar complaints.",1,20,2021-05-13 07:43:25
"Just finished the 6 week program Centr 6. Following a free trial I've paid for the app, because I really feel its worth it! I've seen a huge difference in my appearance. I feel healthier and more motivated than ever. From beginner to advanced, there's workout for everyone. The recipes are beneficial and easy to follow. The sleep visualisations and meditations have really helped me and my family. I honestly cannot rate this app highly enough!",5,1,2020-05-18 11:34:53
"Incredibly user friendly and aesthetically appealing. It's motivating without trying too hard. Its range of flexibility as you interchange meal options fits your individual needs. Ingredients can be easily searched with a grocery shopping bag that makes preparing for your meal easy and fun. It's not just a fitness app, it stands out from the rest by promoting long term healthy lifestyle choices for physical, mental, and nutritional growth.",5,0,2020-05-21 10:44:38
"All in all an excellent app, covers all my needs (exercises, delicious recipes, meditation). Digital grocery shopping list based off of recipes I have selected has made my life much easier! Small improvement would be to be able to view/tick off groceries while offline. Only issue I have found is that the exercise equipment filter needs some more work, it still includes exercises using equipment I have filtered out. But still, amazing app guys, your team should be proud!",5,24,2021-06-24 15:08:13
"Absolutely incredible, this app has everything to get you in shape. The planner helps me to organise my day making it so much easier and the shopping list makes it so much quicker to get what I need. Variety of different meals even some treats at the end of the week and the workouts are so well taught. Love this app and I am feeling better than ever thanks.",5,4,2020-06-03 12:02:04
"Not good enough for being the most expensive app for training. I've been using the app for about a month now and I have to say it didn't meet my expectations. I was looking for an advanced, all-around training assistant and given the hefty price tag, the trainers and some of the reviews, I thought this might be the one. Some technical complaints: - If you switch to another app in the middle of a session (even during rest) the timer stops working, the same happens when you turn off the screen and the app may even close after a while - The interface for logging the weights is clunky, you have to traverse a few 'touches' before getting to it About the programs: - I chose a Centr advanced program and I've been following it, however it doesn't seem to integrate to my daily routine because the app keeps showing other workout for 'daily routine'. - The recipes and great, however there's no weekly planner and only a meager shopping list - The customization is not nearly as half as other similar apps Despite this I think it is a good app, the programs are great and the trainers are first class; it just feel like an incomplete product for being the most expensive traing app on the market.",2,18,2022-05-22 11:25:13
"I've tried lots of other fitness apps but lost interest. This one's different. The best thing is the variety of workouts on offer. Your plan says weights but you feel like boxing? No problem, just swap it out. But it doesn't stop at the workouts. There's a great meal plan tailored to your goals as well as things like meditation and sleep visualisation (I do these with my 9yr old). On top of that there's the FB community - those legends are the icing on the cake 😁",5,11,2020-02-14 10:12:52
"2nd time around after a failed 1st go. 7 days in and still motivated. 30 min workouts and a nice challenge. Heart rate is up and I'm feeling good. App is great, easy to use. I screencast to my tv and it's fine. Just a shame it doesn't support landscape for this and tablets. Bar that slight niggle it's perfect.",5,1,2020-05-18 19:58:49
"I love this app. It has given me a new lease of life. Thank you. I really like the versatility, the videos and the great nutritional and training advice. I love the fact that I can access different workout styles and indeed have help with meditation and mindfulness. The only reason I have give 4 stars is that I'd like to see which muscles each exercise is targeting perhaps by having the relevant body part light up on Torre? It would also be great if there was a forum for ask questions.",4,6,2020-05-27 18:40:03
Keeps signing me out and when I log back in it immediately signs me back out saying my session expired. It's a running subscription. Why is it not letting me use it?,3,1,2023-08-26 18:14:57
"Very easy to use, you can follow a strict day today planner or use it to fit your needs. Lots of verity of exercise, food recipes and information. The meditation is great, lots of different styles for differant people. The food recipies are fun creative and deliciousies, very easy to do as well. I am on the beginner program and enjoying it. I can't do everything but that will come with time. I highly recommend it",5,1,2020-04-23 12:57:48
"I will not be renewing my subscription. I was stuck with it in the first place, customer service is dreadful. You could find similar workouts for free on social media or youtube. A lot of programs on Centr require weights, so I find myself repeating a lot of sessions. They can be challenging which is good, but repetitive. The food side of it looks ok, but again, buy a healthy cookbook and the majority of it is in that. Concept is good, but overly priced and hyped.",2,39,2021-02-25 23:34:02
"Overall very good, app layout is easy and looks good, very good range of content, the coached sessions are led well and really get you working. Only gripe is in some of the hiit training videos the transition between exercises seems to be cut, so even though I keep time and finish the last rep with the trainer, I have to rush to get into the next exercise",4,14,2021-02-23 16:45:51
"This app is incredible for people just beginning a fitness journey. The trainers are enthusiastic and fun, making the workouts enjoyable and of course effective. There is a great variety of workouts to choose from also. The recipes and meditation are equally as useful as the workouts. They are simple to follow, and the layout is amazing. Everything is so easy to find. Would absolutely recommend this app to anyone looking into fitness and wellbeing.",5,7,2021-11-11 21:33:39
"Love Tiffany's workout! I have done them all and we need more! Some of the other instructors are as too hard or too easy for the level you select. Otherwise, the meal plan and meditation are amazing! I would love to have a space to count my calories though, add something else I ate and see my progress pictures. It cast perfectly with Chromecast. I would also add a star/favorite or like button to my favorites workouts, or something that says if I have done or not that workout recently/previously",4,0,2020-05-25 21:45:36
"I love this app and would recommend it to everyone. I love the modified low impact workouts! It would be good to see more offered in the coached workout sessions outside of the programs. Especially Box HIIT, which I love in Fusion. I would also like to be able to track what sessions I have done. And a clear progression in coached sessions would be awesome. I like that the programs take you on a journey, you know where to start and then work up to harder workouts. The programs are amazing!",5,36,2021-03-24 20:17:36
Love the app. The meals are incredibly simple yet great! The daily affirmation podcasts / meditations are great but could be slightly longer and less guided They feel rushed. The workouts are an amazing mix of styles. Love the mma & boxing classes as this is something I've always wanted to try out and now I can along side all the other styles. Only gripe. I wish the workouts said the exercise right before they started saves me having to look at my phone all the time.,4,18,2020-08-28 07:52:14
"I like the app there is a lot of variety with workouts, to the point that I struggle to find what I am looking for sometimes. I know that there are filters for search options but they don't always work that well. Apart from this I do love using this app and the trainers are great the messages are fun to see as well. I have signed up for the year hoping to see some good results now that I am back in the swing.",4,0,2021-02-16 20:49:04
"The app has started to, probably from an update, log me out automatically several times in a row while attempting to access my workouts.",1,4,2023-08-23 02:07:19
"This is great, and the suggestions are wonderful, but I really wish I could set it to only recommend me dairy-free meals. I don't really want to have to swap every recommended meal out for a dairy free meal, but that's what I've been doing. I'd also like to see a variant for intermittent fasting that only includes 2 meals with slightly larger portions",4,7,2019-12-27 23:31:08
"Flexible, easy, lots of.choices.",5,0,2023-09-21 03:17:40
So far so good. I've started with some intermediate level after upgrading from beginner and I'm seeing significant gains. With personal research and cardio training I've also lost some fat. Additionally the meal plans have significantly influenced my diet regiment and options. I highly recommend the app. PS don't forget to check all the tutorials for the workouts. Though I would like to see some more details and some easy to understand language for some complex movements.,5,7,2022-08-06 18:04:14
"Paid for a full year license, Now app won't even log me in for 2 weeks straight... saying session expired... contacting support Only gets me email to YouTube videos and pdf.... 🤦🤦🤦",1,3,2023-08-21 20:47:28
"So good! If you are experienced with the price of other fitness apps and gym memberships you'll understand what good value this is. The workouts are beautifully filmed and there's a huge variety. I only wish the filters included intensity level but most of the workouts are for ""all"" anyway. It's sophisticated in it's navigation around programs and food and shopping list etc and definitely has a better design than other fitness apps. What I like the most is the preview of exercises in the videos.",5,26,2020-11-01 20:42:59
"For the cost, this app is very worthwhile. The workouts vary, I never feel like I'm plateauing, and the shorter workout times are easy to fit into a busy. The meal planning part is also very helpful, especially the grocery list. I do a lot of out of town work so it's nice to have workout options I can do in my hotel/camp room in my pocket. I recommend this app to anyone who is looking for fitness ideas!",5,5,2022-02-05 00:25:01
"It's a great app, and I really enjoyed using it over a year. However I recently discovered I had another email address that was charged the annual amount and I contacted the customer service about it. I believe I used that account to change to a 4 weeks trial but ended up using the one on my phone instead. I understand that the amount for the last year cannot be returned, but for the second charge for 2023 that happened on 21st Feb, they refused to return it due to their terms and services.",1,104,2023-03-03 00:37:52
"In my opinion, it's the absolute best a fitness app can be. It provides you with a very comprehensive, challenging, versatile, productive and fun program, a great and healthy meal plan, loads of useful information and most importantly - real motivation!!! I've never had a better experience or seen more results from any other fitness endeavor in my life! (Bonus: whenever you even think of skipping a sesh, you get to work out with Chris Hemsworth and who's gonna let Thor down? Not me!)",5,2,2020-07-15 21:20:01
"Well worth the money. You get a meal plan, and a huge variety of workouts. Equipment and no equipment options. Multi diet options (best for vegan I've found so far) only thing I've found is sometimes the female portion sizes seem very small to the male (bf is on this too) and occasionally I'm left hungry. But there's tons of snack options too. So much cheaper than a gym and you get so much more. I love it. The food is gorgeous.",4,9,2020-06-05 10:37:21
I can't recommend this app any more - it's truly excellent! The range of workouts is the key - you can select whatever equipment you have handy (or none) and then select the workout / coach that looks good to you and off you go! If you like your workouts brutal check out Tiffiny Hall - you just need a set of dumbbells and a high threshold for pain!!,5,5,2020-07-25 21:01:44
"A money grab that makes it deceptively tricky for you to unsubscribe. There are no details on how to contact them, just an FAQ. They will charge after your trial period without notification every month, no invoice, no receipt, no email. They'll just happily grab your money even if you never used the app. When you want unsubscribe, the first page makes you believe you did... but no, there's a second one after a long lag! Easy to miss and common issue described on many of the negative comments.",1,49,2023-02-28 08:54:23
"A great variety of exercise styles with a considerable amount of exercises and if you choose there are programs for any level at a very reasonable price. The food looks great, although I have not tried it. From a personal perspective I would love to a tracking area so I can track my food/weight goals.",5,0,2021-01-10 20:31:09
Has been a great experience so far. Easy to follow training plans and instructions during the workouts. The recipes are pretty good as well. Only bad point I have with it which is the reason it didn't get 5 stars is that during the coached cool downs the stretches are very generic and don't isolate the muscle groups that was just used. Not a huge problem as I then conduct my own cool down/stretch session afterwards.,4,16,2021-08-27 00:50:00
"Updated after more usage - Good app and programs. Am disappointed that some of the coached programs are just dubbed clips of the trainer's completing an exercise. Would be more motivational if the trainer's were completing the workout as they instructed. Would feel more involved and the encouragement would feel more genuine. Would also be better if the planner could be customized based on available workout equipment. Still recommend trying it out, overall it's a pretty good!",4,15,2021-08-12 00:38:32
"I think its great, it offers a variety of exercises for everyday alongside a 6 week program so you are never at a loss for what to do. It has healthy recipes, articles and meditation sounds to help relax your mind. The only thing I would suggest, to make this app 5 stars, is to maybe be able to project the workout videos onto a smart tv, so its on a wider screen. I find for some workouts, the yoga and pilates especially, I have to constantly move the video so I can see it as I do the poses.",4,8,2020-04-15 12:03:53
"Really enjoying this app. I struggle with motivation to workout, but the weekly programmes allow me to have workouts for the following week without spending time to pre-plan. The recipes are superb, they are tasty and add more variety to your meals. A suggestion I would make is to be able to 'favourite' your favourite workouts and meals etc. If achievable, in future it would also be good to get smartwatch link as well.",5,1,2020-05-23 05:41:02
"It's better to be functional, mobile and agile than it is to look built and be stiff (this was told to me by MANY bodybuilders) THIS app gives everything you need to make you function and move better and feel better about everything, especially yourself. Give a 6 week program a try, stick with it and in the end you'll be amazed at who you've become! P.s. It's not supposed to be easy, but then again if it was easy, everyone would do it.",5,33,2020-12-10 01:54:13
Live the variety of workouts and ability to select skill levels at which you wish to start or advance. The log book is easy to use and welcome directly from the exercise page and the engrained tiners are a time saver for sure. There is a great variety of meals and love the option to switch out any given recipe. Have only been using the app for a couple of weeks but live what I am seeing so far.,5,2,2022-03-03 01:50:01
"I have absolutely loved using this app! It has lots of different workouts to choose from. You can use it at home, gym, park or wherever you love to work out. The only thing I'd change is maybe being able to make a list of favourite workouts to go back to or do again... Apart from that have really enjoyed using it! :)",5,0,2020-06-23 11:57:31
It would be an understatement to say this app has changed my life. As a vegan with a million food intolerances (not to mention ceoliac disease) trying to find a fitness app that has a tasty meal plan and exercises that I enjoy has been years of struggle. My partner and myself have been following a centr workout and meal plan now for over a month and we don't plan on stopping anytime soon. Plus getting a free 3 months during a pandemic is a huge plus in my book 😊 couldn't recommend more!,5,2,2020-07-11 11:22:28
"I have had terrible problems with this app. It is constantly stopping during the workout videos and I get a error message saying this video cannot be played due to technical error. I contacted the help team about the issues and got an email back telling me how I can cancel my subscription which is not what I wanted to do, but looks like I am going to have no choice now. I advise to look into other apps as 5his one seems extremely buggy. I do hope they get this figured out in the future.",1,19,2020-05-13 12:30:33
"Appalling customer service, won't help you with anything. Only interested in taking your money not actually making a good app that people want.",1,1,2023-07-31 14:27:58
Great app but currently broken. Haven't been able to do a workout with the app this morning as it isn't working. Please fix!,2,5,2023-08-11 07:18:59
"I use this app for yoga, but there are only so many workouts, so once you have done them, that's it. No new workouts for yoga in the last year. Also, it would be helpful if the workouts you've done were marked as done. Each time I look for a workout, I need to check which ones I've done. Search memory would be good also. Won't be extending my membership.",3,2,2023-01-20 22:33:29
Recent update made the app impossible to use. I'm constantly being told my session has expired and am logged out even if I just logged back in,1,3,2023-08-25 23:13:00
I'm really surprised how motivating this app is. There are a lot of workouts to choose from and if you don't want to choose there's a suggestion every day. Meal planning is good too. The vegetarian options are bit tough for really getting the calories in and some of the options assume easy access to ingredients that are not always available. Overall really pleased with it though.,4,134,2023-03-06 18:21:59
"Programs are spot on and engaging. Great way to trek through a workout, especially for new older people like me Thank you.",5,0,2023-08-17 10:51:19
After the latest update the app keeps signing me out. I have tried all possible ways to fix and no luck yet. It's been almost a week now.,1,4,2023-08-28 11:16:04
"Been on centr for over a year now and now that the Android app is here they are really doing well. The content is great, the presentation is nice and clean and the added Chromecast support is a relief for me. They have finally reached feature parity with the website which means I can use the app exclusively. My only criticisms are that they tend to recycle alot of footage rather than the trainers following the workouts right the way through, trainers could break a sweat every now and again.",4,5,2020-04-27 07:03:00
"Loving the coached sessions. App could be a little more user friendly in terms of searching for types of exercises, and the option of turning off in video music to allow external music to be played while working out. It would also be great if workouts completed were tracked by the weekly calender bar on top of the daily planner.",4,0,2020-08-24 08:02:56
"Results are showing. I like the exercises, and the trainers. I use this app almost every day. Some things that I would like are: the equipment filter to only show workouts just with the one selected, and for the trainers to show more less impact variations on the exercises, because I have some knee injury. Other than that, all great. Also, please upload more new workouts!",5,2,2020-07-12 11:17:03
"Love it! Very user friendly app with tons of information and lots of variety. Not like the usual apps where they want you to smash it and eat a lettuce leaf. It has real exercises for real people and real food. The only change I would make is to be able to save your favourite recipes, or even print them off.",5,0,2020-05-22 00:52:58
"This is ideal it has so many different options so you can be a beginner or a well trained athlete. This app has you covered. With loads of recipes choices too. You can do it anywhere too, in your living room take it to the gym or even outside when the weather is nice. It has programs you can follow too. Its a really good all rounder.",5,13,2020-10-10 15:15:56
"The app in itself is good, but if u like me miss the last day of your trial before making decision get charged with one year worth of subscription and no way to refund it. Update: the team was extremely helpful and kind, my issue was resolved within a day even though their terms state no refund policy. That definitely proves to me that this app is worth trying, great coached workouts, meals, yoga and much more for anyone who is willing to do the work whether that's at home or in a gym.",5,5,2020-05-17 10:48:01
"In general I like the app, great for beginners. Also it is a great idea to launch workouts without equipment because if you don't have access to a gym you may not have the equipment, however I cannot seem to be able to edit my stats in Android (height, weight, %bf) so I am not sure how it can recommend a diet, but the recipes look all delicious and the shopping list feature is brilliant!",4,20,2020-03-29 03:51:01
"Your credit card info is not safe with Centr! They keep charging it even after the subscription is canceled. There is no customer service number, only email, and they will deny any request for a refund.",1,4,2023-05-30 13:00:17
Legal theft. Great if you love making some guy in Hollywood richer by overpaying for a mediocre app. This app is a pure joke. Where to begin? $120 for next to zero customization. Really poor self-lead workouts with no plans. Tried to give me full meal recommendations without any knowledge of my size and weight. Newsflash: caloric needs vary largely based on size/weight/sex. Customer service is really awful too.,1,5,2023-05-02 17:48:42
App is better now but not a fan of the ugly logo and the dirty lime green colour palette. Please change it. The older logo and colour schemes were classy. This logo makes it look more related to communications/network/Xbox etc. Not fitness.,4,0,2023-05-24 22:17:13
"Loving it, I was skeptical but I'm really really enjoying the app. Tons of great options for workouts and nutrition, worth the price imo",5,3,2023-05-17 13:50:04
It's a great app but it does specify the weight to carry or progress. Do I go from 40lb to 80lb on chest day or stay with a weight for the duration. It is not specified.,3,1,2023-05-24 13:21:15
Good workout app but renews automatically for an year without even sending a reminder abt upcoming renewal. Shows how confident they r abt ppl using this app,2,1,2023-05-29 09:11:51
"Great so far. Still loving it. This is my standard go to now. Wouldn't be without it. Love the new trainers and new options, great variety.",5,1,2023-05-26 18:43:08
"Been using for 5 months and I really love this app. Set to 'advanced - build muscle' the workouts are enjoyable and engaging. But, the planner needs to work better, it seems like your planner and the programs are completely separate: need to be able to easily set your selected program on your planner. You also can't very easily swap around days within your week. But mostly importantly, really needs the option for the timer to run constantly.",4,8,2023-04-10 12:51:38
"The app is great and the workouts push you out of your comfort zone. I am impressed so far. However, please sort out the exercise logging during a workout. It's really difficult to keep stopping and scrolling for the correct rep and weight whilst keeping up with the workout. Please redo the logging so it's quicker to log and doesn't take too much time. I've used other apps where it is much more user friendly",4,2,2023-01-05 17:54:57
"I bought the yearly subscription during the Cyber Week deals so it was a lot cheaper than what it is usually, but I can 100% say that it was well worth the money, the workouts and meals are perfect for my fitness level (an absolute beginner). I've loved the variety in both workouts and meals, the meditation is also a wonderful asset for the app, if you're considering getting the app I highly recommend it, but you may want to wait for a deal to come around so it is not as expensive.",5,19,2023-01-03 04:52:12
"Amazing app. Great guided workouts, the were a few gaps around programmes etc but Centr seem to be addressing. Always room for improvement so personally I'd like to see more very basic yoga for people like me with the flexibility of an iron bar and some alternatives for some of the ingredients in some of the meals (that last one is a bit picky to be honest).",5,1,2020-05-18 18:25:35
The app has been down for over a week. Near impossible to do a workout or follow a diet if you can't even log in!,1,3,2023-08-26 12:30:54
Constantly kicks me and makes me log in over and over again. Now it's not letting me log in at all. Why pay for no access to content?? I want my money back. This is a rip-off.,1,5,2023-08-27 08:33:55
"Not able to log in at all in the last few days, terrible especially since I've paid for a year subscription.",1,2,2023-08-28 13:40:44
"This app was not what I was looking for, I can imagine it could be great for others. I thought I had cancelled my free trial, not realising that the first place you click to cancel takes you to another page where you have to confirm you want to cancel (after a significant lag period). I contacted Centr Help immediately and was not refunded despite being only a day or two into the billed period. Disappointed with the customer service.",1,45,2022-07-18 05:29:59
"Superb!Since the Android app has been created this app has changed the way I exercise. It's hard to fit everything in during the days but this app has different variations of exercises, meditation, recipes for meals and some very interesting articles. The trainers, although on first glance appear super human, (No pun intended for Thor) are very engaging, encouraging you to push yourself within your limits and dial a back a notch when pushing too hard. Next best thing from a PT",5,1,2020-06-17 11:49:39
"Finally the app has come to Android! Good at first glance, and easy to use and get around. Love that you can add snacks to your shopping list... I enjoy the food. It's only as expensive as you choose to make it. Yes they suggest meals but you can swap them depending on your budget weekly. The workouts are fantastic and quick compared to others.",5,42,2019-12-16 19:00:11
"When I came across a free trial of this program I didn't expect to be blown away by how awesome it is! The thing that has stood out to me the most is the meal plan. I love that I don't have to think about what to cook. I just increase the amount of servings to feed the whole family, add it to the shopping list in the app and off I go. I have learnt lots of little time saving hacks to be able to reduce prep time and everyone loves the food. Best app!",5,1,2020-04-20 20:55:13
"Absolutely the best workout program I have ever used. diverse workouts-doesn't get boring. I'm amazed at the progress from each workout, they get you into it smoothly and without realizing you get done a lot. The progress on the body is insane. Meal plan is super easy to use and easy to prep. love the shopping list. The biggest surprise were the inspirational and meditation audios. With 30kg on top from pregnancies mental breakdowns ,thats the 1st program to lift me up physically and emotionally",5,1,2020-05-16 15:42:11
"Absolutely fantastic program! I love the workouts. Also love that the daily program includes meditation, podcasts and meals. App functionality is also great. If anyone from Centr reads this, one extra feature I would find love to have is the capacity to save favourite workouts. Would love to be able to sub those workouts in exchange for a workout that I'm not keen on doing.",5,2,2020-04-17 05:56:52
"The most annoying thing is that it doesnt load, error mesages. The workout is fine but there is a bug within the server. It happens on the app and the website. I cleared cookies, cache, uninstalled app. Everything and it doesnt work.",3,2,2023-08-26 14:00:17
Constantly crashes. Was great when it worked. Now it's pretty useless. Need to login atleast 45 times every morning before I can get a workout in. Support team keeps saying they are fixing the issue but it's been over 2 weeks now and no end date of this problem in sight,1,12,2023-08-25 13:17:27
"Great instructors and workout programs, I love the variety of different workouts and instructors available, also programs to suit all skill levels and equipment you have. This really helps to keep me motivated. I just wish it had the functionality to track a history/display all of all the workouts I have previously completed (perhaps in a calendar view aswell). Also an option to save workouts I want to try into a 'wishlist' so I don't have to keep going through the list and searching again.",4,1,2020-05-01 00:42:23
"Was a great app, can't log in at all now, just immediately says session expired, unfortunately I'll be trying to get a refund as it is unusable now.",1,3,2023-08-26 14:31:11
"Pros: The guided workouts are great, and there are a huge variety of programs to choose from, no matter what your level of fitness or the equipment you have (or don't have). I also like the free recipes. Cons: The profile seems really gimmicky and pointless to me since it doesn't ask crucial questions such as your height and weight, or your goal weight. I'm not even sure that the information it does ask for changes much since you can select any program you want regardless of the planner.",4,36,2021-04-14 02:34:50
"Totally worth it. I've seen improvements in just a couple of weeks. The diet suggestions are great as well, tons of options and always delicious and simple to prep. Even if I don't follow the recipe, at least I got the ingredients and can play with them on my own knowing that I have the right nutrients. Just doing one of the programs (centr ignite) and it has a wide range of exercises that are simple enough for me but still hitting my body in the right way (thanks Luke and Alexz!) Cheers, mates!",5,3,2022-12-18 21:56:55
"Overall a really great app! PROS: - I love that you have a daily view on everything including your meals, your exercises, meditation and reads. - The meals have also been absolutely delicious and love how they change each day. - The shopping list functionality CONS - Exercises are more for beginners - I would however have assumed a higher protein content in the meals (I am a pescetarian).",4,11,2021-08-24 07:11:49
"This used to be the best app of its type. Then Chris sold out to a corporation, they laid off a bunch of staff, and it has gone way downhill. App hasn't been working for two weeks now. Greed has once again ruined something good.",1,3,2023-08-23 16:42:42
"Did the week trial, loved what I saw. Only improvements I could see in my brief use would be to make the next workout available offline, where I workout has a poor internet connection so would be nice to download one the night before. Also I initially selected one month trial and decided to upgrade to the full year for the cheaper price, but couldn't figure out how to simply upgrade my plan.",4,25,2022-10-22 07:30:56
"Best. App. Ever. I suck at sticking to fitness and nutrition - this app makes it easy and the fb community that comes with it is amazingly motivational. The workouts are tailored to what you want (lose weight, tone up, gain muscle) and your level of fitness. The meals have been amazing, I feel like a professional chef at home, and the meals are filling as well. The meditation and sleep visualization are also very relaxing and help with unwinding after a long or stressful day!",5,8,2020-02-16 07:29:47
"User friendly app,with alot of variety. Definitely can help alot of people reach their fitness goals in a broad sense. Lacks the ability to tailor to each user's needs or wants. e.g. I am wanting bigger inner pecs, and would love to get into calesthetics. But coached or self styled workouts I feel don't match what I want. There is a 30min program called simply the chest but focuses more on the core. The app offers short convenient exercises. Defs an app that works and you can trust. Try it out.",5,6,2021-11-24 01:52:31
"I just love it! I use the programs which I find best to keep exercises daily. From time to time I also do what scheduling gives me. I like how it welcomes all levels in the goal to healthy body, not to some fitness ideals. I also like meditations, but wish the sleep visualisations were a bit longer. The meals I aften use as an inspiration for my cooking. One feature I lack is the ability to cast just any workout or video in the chrome cast, not only guided workouts.",5,1,2020-06-20 12:10:37
"For the 1st time in 3 years of using Centr 3 to 6 days a week with zero glitches, I had technical issues logging in (update: they fixed it quickly, and I'm back at it!). I realized how much I depend on Centr. I tried some alternatives and wasn't impressed. I'm the fittest I've ever been, happy and confident. Love mixing up HIIT, weights, yoga, plyo, functional, depending on my mood and goals. Tasty recipes. The meditations are so helpful. The trainers make me laugh and it keeps me going :).",5,1,2023-08-14 14:20:06
Great app and very effective program. I'm enjoying the variety and freedom to change things up if I feel like a different workout that day. I've done a few of the meals and snacks and they've all been delicious so far. I started out on the 6 week free trial with 3 months membership at the end and I've just upgraded to the full year. I'm sold!,5,3,2020-07-10 09:29:56
"Love the app, has a wide variety of workouts, meal plans, and other various features for many types of people. Its organized well and helpful. The only thing i feel that would make it better is if it had a section for people to message someone (so it isn't just ticking boxes and getting a one plans suits many workout)about what workouts, meal planning and such suits them best. So it would talk about how active they are, and what they can do, a personal experience rather then a automated one",4,115,2019-12-28 04:24:49
"I think Centr is absolutely amazing! I love all the options and having exercises, meditations, and meals all in one convenient place. The app does seem a little more simple than some of the other apps I've used in the past but I think that it is in a good state currently. Again I love it and will continue to use it. I just wish that it stood out a little more. I have already recommended Centr to multiple people and will continue to do so! The team has done and fantastic job!",5,1,2023-04-26 21:40:03
I love the variety of workouts and how you can select time-frames when you only have 30 min to workout that day.,5,0,2023-08-13 12:35:46
The app logged me out and now I can't log back in. It'll load for a second then say session expired log in again which I have but nothing works,1,4,2023-08-12 04:49:46
"Awesome app!!! I'm a beginner and it is helping me so much. It has meditation, podcasts, work outs, meal plans and more! The only problem I have is most of the meals are not at an affordable price. Like expensive nuts and meat cuts and stuff I don't even know where I would get it from 🤔 I just use substitutes though. Love it love it love it ❤️",5,46,2020-01-11 20:07:59
"I've been using this app from 3 years and absolutely love it. Trainers are fantastic, all the programs and workouts are fantastic and the nutritional info, meals and snacks are fantastic too. Also great to be able to cast the workouts to your TV if you have a Chromecast or the like. I can't fault this app at all.",5,1,2023-02-15 08:29:01
Really like this app for days I can't hang with budz at the club.,4,0,2023-09-08 22:36:27
"Works ok on Android, on iOS not so much (full screen doesn't stay on from time to time etc.). Some instructors are annoying as hell (""to get to the next level, use your body to the maximum...""), and some of the exercises are very one dimensional (e.g. no back muscles in ""full body workouts""). Anyhow, all in all, a decent way to train during lockout.",3,13,2020-11-07 18:08:54
"Phenomenal app, well worth the subscription price. Great recipes, great coaches and workouts, and I also like that they pay attention to mental health and offer you plenty of options and alternatives for your own busy lifestyle. With that being said, I'm just giving it a 4 star rating to factor in some quality of life options that I think should be added. Like for example looking for workouts that ONLY use the equipment you have, and not ones that use your equipment and then some.",4,29,2023-03-27 16:12:51
"Good overall . Self guided workout needs improvments and could be more intuitive tho. Videos are often glitching/ stopping . When the video stops and you will see a black screen instead , you will have to exit the workout and come back again .. bit of a headach when you r in the middle of your training.",3,6,2022-07-19 08:05:34
"Founding member and still loving it. Programs vary beginner to advanced, lose weight, tone or build muscle. Different dietary options also available. App is easy to use and navigate through. Any tech issues have been resolved very quickly. Highly recommend!",5,1,2020-04-10 01:35:15
It's pretty good though I think there should be more variety. Most of the workouts (weights/) are very similar every week,3,1,2023-06-10 01:27:03
"Just getting back in to a consistent workout regime. Really appreciate the option of Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced for each program, which makes me feel that I can come as I am instead of feeling inadequate. Looking forward to exploring all that the app has to offer!",5,0,2021-03-12 10:09:02
"Was great ... The app worked great the first year. But since last month, it crashes all the time. Constant log in issues with you kicked out and unable to access multiple programs. Centr knows this yet doesn't communicate to it's members. I found out this was a system wife issue via Centr Facebook page. I have reached out to customer service multiple times and got back only generic responses saying working on the issue. 50/50 usage now. This is like fat Thor now except not funny.",1,4,2023-08-26 11:42:37
"Great workouts and reciepes, app is really easy to use and navigate.",5,0,2023-07-16 21:01:09
"At this point I see it as best fitness app on market. You have a plan based on your goal. You goal plan includes exercises, meditation (I am new in mediation but I tried and love it), and meal plan. You have different programs of exercises and food that can be replaced if you don't feel like eating certain dish that's recommended you can always switch. Big plus for their shopping list based on what food you decide to cook for that week/day etc. They did a good job I am impressed.",5,4,2021-05-04 06:52:05
This app is very versatile!! There are so many options and variations for people with different skill levels and abilities.,5,0,2023-08-01 19:13:41
Workouts are great and include videos so you can get your form right. One massive opportunity for improvement is that it goes through INSANE amounts of data. In two weeks of self guided workouts I used 16GB. You can manually turn off video in each workout but would be great if the data usage could be reduced without having to do that Would be great if there was a way to input an injury or exercises that need to be avoided and have workouts filtered by that or have more exercises substituted,3,5,2022-01-15 22:21:37
A brilliant app that has only gotten better and better since I joined when it first launched. Now has a weight tracker for workouts as well as lots of amazing delicious and easy to prepare recipes. Options for vegans and vegetarians too which is fantastic. Highly recommended for anyone caring about their health and fitness.,5,4,2021-08-29 14:48:35
"Good video workout and has the full package for health. Would be great if you could rate the video for your level of fitness or something. Would also be good to be able to see the menu plan for the following week, haven't been able to use that feature because I can't order the food in advance but all the meal look delicious.",4,1,2020-04-28 07:40:38
"I messed up and downloaded the free trial but failed to use it or cancel in time to avoid the charge. Quite within their rights not to refund me but disappointing that they wouldn't. Edit: Updated to 3 stars, because having paid and not being refunded despite not using the app during the trial I decided to start using it. It's quite good. Two major issues with the workouts are that the times only progress while the screen is on and there is no way to record weights used.",3,5,2021-01-11 04:49:10
"Doesn't work well personalization is mediocre; I'm supposed to be enrolled in a Centr program but a totally unrelated 'daily workout' creeps up every day. Sometimes the workout logger crashes, besides, the timer stops if you switch to another app. Recipes are very specialized and meal planner is almost nonexistent. Shopping list has no integration and is very plain. Despite this, the programs are great as are the instructors. It is unfortunate that the platform is like a beta version",2,2,2022-06-20 01:21:44
"Service has been unusable for the past week due to it constantly logging you out, regardless of what device you use.",1,3,2023-08-23 21:39:30
App is unusable. It constantly crashes and it logs me out all the time. Not worth it,1,2,2023-08-28 18:04:40
"I have seen nothing else close to the quality of this app and the amount of top notch information. It is well designed, you get a lot, nothing is held back from you. Workouts are awesome. With the range of phenomenal trainers throughout the week this app really gives you feeling of having a full team backing you to hit your goals. Great daily recipes for meals, snacks and smoothies but you have full access to the whole ‘cook book’ if you want to chop and change plus a stella shopping list feature that could be its own app. There are enough articles and podcasts during the week for this app to feel almost like a workout magazine (at least to me). If you were to purchase a workout plan, a cookbook, a smoothie book and few workout/health magazines I believe you would be spending more and possibly getting lower quality products. This app also has the flexibility to change what your goals and diet are at any time (i.e. from build muscle at the gym to doing no equipment workouts at home). You can also peruse the workouts for any that you feel like doing at any time. If you are doing a coached or non-coached workout the video will not interfere with your music. You can also scale the quality of the video to save on data usage.",5,13,2020-08-20 00:24:39
"Really easy to use and modify workouts and/or meals. The meal plan is very varied, easy to cook and most of all, super tasty! And you have the peace of mind that it's nutritiously balanced. Haven't encountered any glitches and I've been using it daily for the last 5 weeks. Highly recommend it! Well worth the money!",5,2,2020-04-06 10:09:30
"Exceptional! Workouts are designed for evey experience level and every day life schedules. The meal planning is easy-to-use and fits every level of budget. It took a little bit to get into the grove with it but it was me, not the meal.program. Only possible improvement is matching picture portion with real portion - my meals look similar but double in size. I use the meditation and sleep visualization every day. This truly is a balanced approach to mentall and physical well being! Thank u!",4,26,2020-09-22 11:20:03
"Really enjoying the workouts and the meal planner. Especially the functional workouts and the smoothies. Replaces my other workout, recipe, calorie counting and meditation apps. Definitely second the suggestion of being able to save or favourite recipes and workouts. Maybe a hydration / water intake counter too? Cannot see how to upgrade my subscription on Google Play though. ❤",5,2,2020-02-16 01:59:25
"Update - seriously needs a feedback button. I recently made some cookies and they were awful, like so oily I couldn't tell if it was baked and I love to bake. The UI is easy to navigate and recipes available are easy to follow, but they are a little out of touch with the commoners. Not everyone has a Chris hemsworth sized budget to buy 80% of the ingredients required and the food wastage I've forecasted is phenomenal. Plenty of work out and mindfulness options. Overall a decent app.",3,17,2021-12-01 03:16:58
"Excellent app, loads of features and a great way to plan a more active and healthy lifestyle.",5,0,2023-05-15 05:56:43
Terrible customer service. Canceled my trial subscription on the last day of the trial and come to find out they had already charged me for a year subscription. Contacted customer service and they said I didn't cancel before the new subscription period and would not refund my account. Yet I was still in the trial period when they sent that email. So stupid! Update After a few more emails they finally issued a refund.,1,105,2022-12-15 14:14:43
"Brilliant app, best workout app I've tried in terms of delivering the whole package. One thing I would say is that in the centr6 program the warm up and cool down are always the same no matter what workout you've done but I just chuck on a few extra stretches without any real hassle. The results I'm seeing are fantastic and I'm feeling good about my body again",4,1,2020-05-21 10:45:56
"I absolutely love this app. I find myself more motivated to keep moving with all this app provides and the trainers are amazing. Only one suggestion I have, however: I added a lot of food to my grocery list and ended up short a few items. Realized all the meals that were planned needed those very few things. Is there a way to integrate a system that plans meals around ingredients you currently have. That might also help those who can't find some of the more exotic ingredients?",5,12,2020-09-29 15:48:05
App is unusable for better part of a month. Little to no communication from customer support.,1,3,2023-08-26 14:03:18

"Every workout, every meal, every meditation, every article, have been exactly what I needed. The food is delicious and actually pretty easy to prepare. I look forward to what's going on each day. There is a shopping list to make grocery shopping easier. Would love it if they had non-food categories so I could add TP and laundry detergent and whatever else to the list. Seriously, this kind of programming can't be beaten at this price. I have been working out for 20+ years. Love it.",5,22,2021-02-28 21:06:00
"Meh, the workouts are ok but I wish there was a voiceover explaining the form I'm looking for. Also wish I could cast to a TV rather than squinting at my phone trying to figure out what each move is supposed to look like. As for the recipes, just ridiculous. You should have different levels of menu, from basic ingredients to expensive/hard to find. During the covid19 lockdown most people don't have salmon and bok choy just laying around.",3,4,2020-04-06 10:50:58
"I don't usually bother with reviews, however this deserves one. Love it. Very well structured and has exactly what you need to get fitter, stronger and healthier. The vegan recipes are so good too. Plenty of variety and new stuff always being added. Some of the recipes are rather long winded, however you can easily swap out the ones which you don't want to do. My advise would be stick to 3 meals a week per meal category. This is the fittest and healthiest I've ever been!",5,3,2021-02-28 13:25:33
"App works wonderfully. No bugs. Positives: I like that I can play my music over the workout. I love that I can swap workouts and meals. I love that this app incorporates meditation and other aspects of health beyond the physical. I've tried most of the other popular apps, and this one is my favorite for ease of use and also the variety it offers- MMA, yoga, HIIT, weights etc so you're never bored. A person could replace a recipe app, a workout app and meditation app with this one app. Well done.",5,94,2020-09-01 22:35:47
"I have had the app for 2 weeks and really enjoy it so far! Most everything is easy to follow and there are some great workouts. Being able to start at a lower level and gradually build up the strength, endurance, and coordination required to really exercise is an awesome feature. However, I do wish the yoga would go at a slower pace. The instructor is a lot faster than the other yoga courses I have done before so hopefully you have some prior experience with yoga or you will be left in the dust.",5,11,2021-08-12 14:26:46
"Centr is the perfect balance between user friendly and communicative. The trainers are knowledgeable and friendly and the programs will certainly challenge, or cater to, any fitness level. I just completed my first six week program and highly recommend giving it a shot. I feel more mobile and healthier than I have in years.",5,42,2023-03-23 18:25:44
"Great workouts! downloaded this as a 6 week free trial but am now paying and it's well worth the money! The annual subscription works out at less than a quarter of what k would pay for the gym, and as they are closed this has been a perfect replacement. The centr 6 workout is great to follow along with and I'm already seeing improvements and there a brilliant meal planner that has the best most diverse range of meals to pick from. Best workout app I've tried!",5,1,2020-05-15 08:51:25
I like the app. I mis however a link towards a break down instruction on individual techniques. I do find them sometimes by accident so they do exist. Also with weight training modifications I'm not sure if I have to do the dubbele amount of reps. I do it because I think I need to. Also having an option to lock out Gym equipment would be nice to only see the modification clip. But overall I'm very happy with the app.,4,6,2021-06-24 04:55:35
I love this app. Workouts are spot on and instructors are great. Food caters perfectly to my vegetarian diet and is easily swapped if I choose. Meditations and Sleep visuals also seem to work - haven't finished one yet though as I always fall asleep during them! Seeing great change in my shape and getting stronger for sure. Wish I'd found this sooner as wasted money on various other apps in the past. This is money well spent.,5,5,2020-08-06 10:49:25
"I thought it was only fair to update my review as I came across the Centr app again after 1 and a half years since my previous review. My main issue was the lack of options for people with no equipment, which is not an issue whatsover anymore. There are plenty of non equipment workout options. Recipes are delicious, which is a nice plus. My suggestion would be to ask the equipment availability during profile creation and only recommend workouts that match that option in the planner. Great app!",4,74,2021-09-14 07:14:54
"Absolutely LOVE this app. The team, classes, meals, variety of workouts are all fantastic! I can't wait to see what they do and how they further this app to be even more remarkable! I would be so thankful to see an update of being able to have a personalized tab where you can save recipes and workouts, or be able to save workouts/meals to your own personal weekly schedule! I give it four stars only because there is always room for improvement in all thing, but I truly love it like a five star!",4,21,2020-01-02 23:56:32
I like guided workout using our TV instead of using the small screen of my phone. This is the only fitness app that I know which has an ability to stream in my TV using Chromecast. Monthly subscription is more pricey compared to other apps but Centr makes home-based training more interesting and easy to follow. Ability to plan meals and create grocery list is great but recipe needs to be simpler. Wishlist: Direct integration with wearables and smartwatch to make daily fitness tracking easier.,4,1,2020-07-27 22:01:46
"Hmmm.... just did my first strength workout and there was a bonus workout as well. I have got the 31 day free trial atm, but coming from a very active person, personal trainer and someone who is always wanting to try new things, i was disappointed in the workout due to the fact that there was not a lot of variety and when it came down to the cool down nothing was focused on the legs even though it was predominately legs. It would be good if you could rate each workout after you have completed it",3,9,2023-01-25 01:34:44
"Great overall health and fitness app. The recipes are excellent, you get the choice of having a coached workout or do it yourself. The videos show you how to do each exercise. I would like if you could sort the individual workouts better, like if I wanted to do chest and triceps and pick and choose from different sets you've made up.",4,17,2021-09-30 23:30:16
"I had the same experience as the other reviewers, it seems as though it's a scam. They charged me with no warning for a year's subscription and the day they charged I reached out to let them know that I can't even use the app because it doesn't give me the option to mirror to my TV so I have to do the workouts from my phone (as other reviews say). Got the same cold financial email saying they're not giving me a refund. So now I'm stuck w a year's worth of subscription to workouts i can't use",1,30,2022-01-27 20:08:14

LOVE LOVE LOVE this app and the program. It has kept me motivated and on track with the daily exercises. The variety helps immensely and really makes it easy to actually WANT to do them. The instructors are amazing and each exercise is broken down into pieces that make you feel like you can literally do anything. Thank you so much - Rose,5,27,2020-08-07 18:23:59
"LOVE IT! I was missing Orangetheory because I would rather workout hard following directions rather than think of my own workouts. This is also kinder to my wallet which is why I quit Orangetheory. I'm seeing great results with the variety of workouts and I love the recipes, articles, and extra stuff you get with the app. Completely recommend for anyone of any shape because I am dangerously overweight for my height and have lost inches in just 3 weeks of the workouts. They are so much fun too!",5,0,2020-05-18 21:06:38
"I'm liking the app so far but I think there's a few things that they can do to improve the experience 1. allow you to favorite some of your exercises so you don't have to search for them every morning 2 allow you to take individual sections and create your own exercise plans 3. be able to download some of them offline for when you don't have internet handy. 4. have a Roku, Amazon fire stick or Apple TV app",4,10,2020-04-29 11:47:22
I signed up for this app for the 6 free week trial thinking I'll cancel before I get billed. I regret not looking at the workouts earlier. The app and the website are super easy to navigate. I'm currently doing the Centr 6 program which got me to subscribe for a year. It's unfortunate that a lot of the negative reviews are from people who didn't read the billing terms. I had an issue with the original card I signed up for so canceled two days before my trial ended no prob and resubscribed after.,5,0,2020-05-16 19:23:24

"This app is awesome! It has workouts for every type of fitness across the board, not to mention the fantastic recipies and snacks! It has a planner option and builds out your week for you and they are constantly putting out new programs based on user feedback. Couldn't ask for a better fitness app and I definately don't plan on switching anytime soon or ever",5,0,2021-06-17 02:49:55
"I've signed up for a year subscription and really like the content and UI so far. I think what is missing for me is videos on mastering form outside of the workout sessions and also spoken cues within the workout. A personal trainer would correct poor form but with an app, how do you ensure that people are mastering the correct form? That would be the ultimate improvement.",4,4,2022-10-21 05:18:51
Have been loving this app. I get thru my works and completely follow through don't wonder around my phone as much and keeps me more focus. I really enjoy the combination of the workout samael's and the medication part which I think is very important to the body. Love the results but I've been seeing and how consistent I am with it. Highly recommended!,5,4,2023-04-03 22:13:07
"Great workouts and vegan meals. Unfortunately, I'm having the same problem as others, I can't cast any more. Happening from my Android and my wife's iPhone, across 2 different Google Chromecasts (one is only 4 months old).",5,0,2023-04-17 07:15:07
"Love this app! Nice layout. Great workouts that mix it up from my normal routine, and you can follow on a Chromecast. I like that the range of exercises means I get a combination of HIIT, strength and mobility training throughout the week without even thinking. And honestly, really good and really easy vegan recipes that make it easy to track calories and macros.",5,1,2020-04-14 20:23:12
"This is a holistic app: exercise+food integrated so you don't need to think about it, just do it.",5,1,2023-07-04 21:32:00
This app is a great accessory and guide for people who want to be fit of any experience level. Each week the exercise groups you do each day (depended on level of intensity) vary keeping your body on its toes and keeping the workouts fresh and challenging. This app also has different workouts based on your fitness goals and different meal plans for those goals. I started working out using this app almost a couple months ago and I'm loving it.,5,0,2020-05-18 20:24:52
"Fantastic app and quality product within. Easy to use and navigate. Now the function of saving ""your own favourite"" exercise/food/mediation/blog story, etc, available it's so easy to return to what you like. The daily planner gives great inspiration based on your preferences at set up too, for food and possible exercise plans. Both myself and my 6 year old adore the meditation options. My LO uses the kids meditation & kids sleep mediation every night. I swear by it to aid relaxation and sleep",5,17,2020-12-05 16:04:57
"I have tried many fitness apps and programs in the past but I haven't been able to stick to anything for more than a week. This is the first time I have been using an app and sticking to a routine for more than two months now. I love both the coached and self guided routines in the app, the ease of use, breakfast/lunch/dinner recommendations and meditation. Kudos to the team.",5,39,2023-01-15 16:42:17
"Love this whole app. I mainly use the workouts and meditations and podcasts. The food planner is my next thing to tackle. The coached workouts are my fav, and I'm feeling like every time I do a new workout I feel that bit stronger. I haven't done any fitness in 10years, and I was so excited when it was announced to come to android, I jumped on straight away and have been working out often using the app. Love it, super easy to use too! 5🌟 for sure ! Thanks heaps ! Rebecca 🙏",5,2,2020-02-15 01:50:41
"This app is incredible! After paying more for less from other apps and Instagram, I was skeptical but it's the best investment I've made. All workouts show you how to adapt to home workouts with minimal equipment, and the meal plans are genuinely delicious. Never looking back, life changing program!",5,3,2021-02-22 18:18:05
"I'm impressed. Could do with sorting the timer out though. If you leave the app during a rest to read a message or change a song, the countdown stops. Other than that it's great. Update: Boxing by Michael Olajide is very poor. No countdown timers and poor instructions. I did not know what I was doing with my hands most of time. Please update this! Also the cool down is not a cool down. That's a warm up man..",4,54,2023-03-21 10:40:45
"The workouts are great and the other stuff is pretty good. If I had to complain about one thing it would be that you aren't able to record your lifts in the app. There are plenty of weight lifting apps that let you record your lifts and even tell you when you hit PRs, but it's clunky switching back and fourth between apps. This is really my only complaint.",4,17,2021-05-10 23:06:35
"I like the Centr6 program for beginners. The instructors explained and showed the moves first time around, then the next reps the had voiceovers that explained it again and were encouraging. All the other components of the app I haven't really explored but there seems to be a lot of value there. I like the meditation component.",5,2,2020-05-07 20:19:02
"So far i am very pleased, the planner gives surprise variety, but i can still look up specifics to my mood. The understanding to have 3 skill levels at once is encouraging and feels more personal. Lastly the completion tracking, meals all day, and articles about things other than ads, put me right in the warrior persona i thought i had lost. Keep up the good work, great team!",5,3,2020-04-07 06:52:25
"The program so far is great!! I tried 8fit before but got bored with the repetitive workouts... Not here! I'm currently doing the Centr6 program, which does have repeated workouts, but it doesn't get boring because the videos are pretty interactive - with coaches trading silly comments and random encouragements throughout your reps and rounds. Just wish the app would send stats to Google Fit (#firstworldproblems).",4,4,2020-02-05 04:26:49
"I love this app! Never had any glitches, I've been using it for about 5 months now and I love that I've been able to find variety both in workouts and in meals. My only critique is that I wish that there would be a few more targeted coached workouts (focusing on lower body or upper body) as opposed to most being full body. It would also be nice to have workouts for people who do have more equipment like a barbell, bench, squat rack etc. However, all of the coaches are fun and encouraging!",5,0,2021-01-17 19:18:51
"Best workout app I tried so far! The overall offering is just amazing - from the huge variety of workouts, the meal planner and the meditation sections, everything is awesome and feels perfectly curated. It gives you the best pre-made workout plan while still giving you the opportunity to adapt everything to your needs. Definitely staying on this one.",5,18,2020-10-12 18:13:02
"Crash crash crash. Uninstall, reinstall, works for 2 min, crash again and again. Garbage",1,3,2023-08-24 11:42:30

"Love everything about this app 💕 Highly recommend it! Well rounded approach to not just fitness but overall well-being. It has helped me incorporate and maintain a healthier lifestyle and I couldn't be more grateful! The app is easy to navigate and nice to look at. Workouts are varied and interesting. Trainers are engaging and relatable. Recipes are simple and tasty. Sleep meditations are relaxing and do their job 💤 Lastly the articles are relavent and helpful. Again, I highly recommend. Thx",5,53,2020-11-10 02:07:47
"Many facets of ""health"" in one app - meal prep and nutrition, mediations and workouts. There are a LOT of options in each of those areas, which I love. The meal prep includes snacks and meals and it is easy to find recipes to fit specific needs, like vegetarian, and the ingredients you have. The workouts include no equipment works all the way to gym workout and levels from beginner to super fit. I love the mediations most bc there a lot of them and I do better w a guided meditation. Well done!",5,4,2023-01-25 14:50:28
"Brilliant work outs. Toned to loosing weight and building core strengths. All workouts on building muscle are self guided, although they do walk you through some basics. But the trainer's are incredibly knowledgeable, got good personalities, and have great chemistry with each other. Which actually makes a big difference when it comes to helping you get motivated. The majority of the meals are too elaborate and include one or two uncommon ingredients, plus no cookery videos. But overall it Works!",4,6,2020-06-22 19:22:52
"This program has been, by far and away, the best at-home workout app that I have tried. The exercises are unique, wonderfully challenging, and highly motivating. Not to mention the expansiveness of the content. Thank you for kicking my butt, Centr team! Keep up the stellar work and I will do the same. 🤘🏼",5,0,2020-08-03 19:38:53
"Has been working great for me for the last 2 months. Recipes are tasty and easy to follow, the work outs are varied and challenging. Living in a place with poor phone reception and having my home gym a fair distance from my wifi modem I would like to see an option to download a workout (or a week at a times worth) to access when off-line, similar to a premium Spotify account, to prevent drop outs and interruptions to the work out. Otherwise the app is fantastic.",4,8,2022-01-05 03:00:37
"Great app, probably going to cancel my gym membership and just start using this (after my free trial finishes)! The coached workouts are great if you need motivation and like a ""fitness class"" style workout. Found plenty of no-equipment workouts I can easily do in my small living room at home. Seems like having some dumbbells/kettle bells would enable you to take better advantage of what the app has to offer though.",5,0,2020-05-17 01:18:11
"The training and meal plans are fun and easy to follow, with substitutions in the trainings for if you cannot get to the gym. The UX is well considered, so the app is easy to use. I would request the Centr product team to give the option to add workouts to the planner. I'd be interested to track progress on this and perhaps to see if that impacts the meal plan.",5,9,2021-03-09 16:11:26
"This app helps you to be consistent with your daily workouts. In planner I like that there is always great rotation between exercises so you can't get bored with them. Also the Programs are a huge help for me, make me to always get momentum and once I start it, for me there is always only one way to end it, right at the end after the finish line :) Thanks Centr for being here with and for us. All the best, Adrian!",5,47,2020-09-12 06:39:48
"This is a workout app equivalent to a Cheesecake Factory menu. Not at all simple. I thought I was going to input my weight, height, goal and it was going to give me a personalized workout and diet plan, instead I gotta go and pick if I want to do polatis or some other stuff from a trainer I've never heard of. Too complicated, canceled and uninstalled immediately... sucks though, I was going to pay for the full year.",1,9,2021-04-01 15:36:54
Loving the app. Easy to use and well structured and motivational to crack on and get through it. Very good.,5,0,2023-06-29 16:00:43
"Great variety of routines. I was pretty fit but this has really up the intensity to a whole new level. Only reason not 4 star is because the coaching could be a bit clearer on some of the routines especially the boxing. Not great when you gave to keep looking at the screen so much. Overall though, well worth it so far.",4,5,2020-08-21 09:39:54
Had off and on routine with it. Then few days ago I discovered 6 week programs. It's awesome. I'm going through beginner one and feeling great. The exercises are of right intensity. I do get benefit but I'm not too toured to ratiinalise skipping a day. A good addition for daily workouts and other formats will be to have it tracked on a calendar so that irregular folks like myself can see how many weeks since thy moved their lazy...,5,0,2020-07-17 09:28:07
"Great fitness and overall health app. For me definitely worth the yearly price. In two months I feel stronger than I have ever felt and am seeing noticeable results in my body (and I'm not a fitness junky). Good variety of recipes to swap from and the meditations are soothing after a long day or just to relax after the workout. The sleep visualizations are also particularly pleasant. I have been recommending this pretty consistently to friends and family, and I don't plan to stop.",5,21,2021-03-07 03:25:12
"Yes it isn't free to use, but not only do professional trainers run through exercises with you, the app makes a weekly calendar for you based on the length of your subscription, which includes daily workouts, daily (delicious) recipes for breakfast, lunch and dinner, meditations, amazing articles, reading and tips, snacks for when you crave something sweet, and a wrap-it-up workout at the end of the week. However, for clarity with the recipes, Centr should add videos going through each recipe :)",5,2,2020-05-30 02:26:35
"I've tried multiple fitness apps and this one by far exceeds them all. The workout are varier and challenging but at the same time being accessable to all even those without equipment. The recipes are so delicious and you can tailor them to your dietary requirements - the app includes yoga, meditation, fitness advice , nutritional advise. In terms of value for money , there really is no better app. I love the app and the Team of trainers. Although a little cheesy @ times, they get the job done",5,0,2022-06-06 03:04:24
"Meal plans are on point, absolutely fantastic. The meditation is great. The works for building mass are so close to being good. They NEED a way to track weight lifted IN APP. Without in app strength tracking and personal weight gain/loss I'll probably cancel my subscription next billing cycle as right now it's only the meal plans and meditation that's keeping my on board. Edit: with the changes adding weight tracking and Centr Power the app is perfect.",5,40,2021-11-08 19:45:22
This app is EXCEPTIONAL and worth every penny. The coached workouts are done so well and are so motivating. I started with the 7 day trial but signed up for the year. I like working out from home so I love the ability to search and filter by equipment I have available to me. There are loads of options. I feel stronger after just a week. The meal plans are great. You can set those to your diet preferences. (Android user & have no problems w/ the app. I also use my laptop for a bigger screen),5,25,2020-02-05 18:15:20
"Enjoying the app. more options for weights would be good (eg cable machine option of 27.7... closest can put .75. Would be cool if I could edit what I logged, I've accidentally entered stuff and just had to leave it. It would b cool if I could link other music and create Ur own play lists... can have it run in the background but can't always hear the beeps for the next exercises. And the rest timer stops if I exit app). & Doesnt let u log alt exercise. Otherwise really enjoying it. Worth price.",4,13,2022-03-05 11:01:58
"I've made tasty recipes, enjoyed varied workouts, and like the meditations -esp the sleep ones. I wish scaling the recipe portions was a bit more fluid. Sometimes when you go to make larger potions the spices seem way off. But love that with meal planner, I only need one shopping trip and have much less food waste. Wish you could print recipes Yoga flow feels a bit fast for beginners. Foundation train is a killer but I feel better for it Overall, this covers the bases for me and glad to have it",5,30,2020-12-14 22:36:27
BEST EXERCISE APP EVER. The workout plan actually seems to be programmed for your preferences and what you're trying to work on. I love all the trainers and appreciate the variety of classes offered. The recipes are fire. And I so enjoy reading the blog posts. Worth every penny.,5,0,2023-05-24 01:27:26
Unusable since a few days. Can't login anymore. Expired session. Will update comment once fixed,5,2,2023-08-17 06:13:42
The fees for this app is REDIC only the rich can afford to be fit As to your response the app store doesn't show pricing on my app. I had to download and sign in to see pricing and as to the $10 a month is if you sign up for a whole year. Shorter terms cost way more. I was excited that you had gluten free menu options cause I am still trying to learn how to live gluten free. However; I can't swing another monthly bill. Very disappointing,1,1,2023-04-07 00:48:38
"I have tried a number of fitness apps. This one has been the most intuitive, and included the largest variation of workouts. The inclusion of meditations and advice has also helped me stay on track and the recipes are realistic to prepare taste like real food (not diet food)!",5,2,2022-12-18 07:46:42
Good sessions but could use more refined filters I enjoyed the sessions but there's no way to track which sessions you've already done and if you liked or disliked them. Also a filter by time feature would be useful and bit more variety of length work outs. All in all good but with few tweaks could be great!,3,0,2020-05-18 10:16:22
"A truly holistic approach to your health that's achievable. Each day there's a plan with 25 mins of exercise, 3 super healthy meals, a motivational article, a meditation and a sleep visualisation. I've done a week and love not having to think for myself all day and waste time with multiple apps or lists. So so good.",5,0,2020-09-14 20:37:46
"I would love it if there was an option for a gift card or something, because I've loved the app so much and want to be able to share it with my family. Honestly though, it has excellent workouts, amazing recipes, and great tips to get your day headed in the right direction. I started with the trial membership and ended up getting the full year subscription because it's been so great! I had gotten up to 285lbs, and within about two months I had dropped down to 240lbs. So I think it works!",5,15,2022-10-12 04:54:23
Used this app for a long time now (2 + years) and it is a great fitness and wellness app. So much variety in the meals I rarely eat anything not on the menu and they have a healthy version of most of my favourite meals. There is such a huge variety in workouts that I've never been bored and always have something to work towards!,5,0,2022-07-27 11:32:27
This is the best exercise program I have found. It has guided meditations and a variety of exercise programs with different intensity levels for each. The coaches help keep you motivated and help you push through. The background music they have isn't extremely intense and you can still hear the coaches. So glad I got this.,5,0,2022-01-12 22:55:48
"I really LOVE this app!! Only on my first week of getting back to using it after a few months, but I'm glad that I'm back at it.

"This app has been amazing for me. I am very time poor and previously exercise has gone on the back burner. With Centr i am able to fit in workouts where ever i have a free moment as well as the option to do something less intense like yoga or up the intensity with a HIIT. The consistency in my workouts has seen results not only in my mental health and fitness, but also no longer having issues with a previous injury. My O steo is amazed and happy.",5,27,2021-03-29 02:38:41
"Love the workouts in the app. But, like many gyms, the gym I frequent is a dank underground space with no reception or WiFi. We need to be able to download workouts for off-line access, because the app becomes next to useless if the recommended exercise is something you're unfamiliar with and you need to rely on the video demonstration.",4,3,2021-03-13 22:40:51
"I love this app. The beginner workouts are actually beginner friendly, the meal section has been so helpful for giving me tasty ideas and portion sizes and have been easily modified for my budget, the meditations are voiced by people who sound like butter.

Have been locked out of the app for days now and only explanation from centr is that they're making upgrades. Not good enough for a $120 app!,1,2,2023-08-28 06:28:19
Honestly the best workout app I've ever seen. There are so many meals and workouts just set out for you to follow. So much effort has been put into this app and it is worth paying for the membership within the app. 10/10 would recommend. I've never been more committed to follow a workout or meal plan before using this. All the hard/annoying things have been done for you.,5,3,2021-01-06 14:31:17
"The selection of routines allows you to learn the techniques and choose favorite routines for each day of the week. The intensity levels allows you to back down in routines which you are overwhelmed and increase the challenge of a routine you already like. Along with the guided routines with clear count downs and the menu for eating right, this app has proven itself with the money.",5,4,2021-02-10 05:59:44
Unfortunately the app is not usuable at the moment. Login and timeout issues for weeks now.,1,2,2023-08-28 17:14:37
I wish each exercise had a demo moment in the guided videos so you can get used to the motion. Ashley's training is especially demanding and I need time to get my body used to the motions but by the time I do I'm 1/3 done and I feel I wasted time. Also this app is really for people that have already done training. Saying this app is beginner friendly is not true. Even as someone that's played soccer for over 10 years this was hard to get into.,3,11,2020-07-01 19:44:06
App does not work.. bought subscription but throws error after logging in saying link subscription and then erroring out after linking.,1,3,2023-08-13 18:28:08
Great Fitness app for beginners to advanced. Easy to follow programs that offer varied exercises with accompanying videos. Wellbeing and lifestyle and recipes are also good although it's tailored more towards a vegetarian diet ( might not be a bad thing ) Would be good if you could run two programs side by side for example strength gain and centr 6 and have them both in your daily planner. Otherwise a great investment if you're serious.,5,0,2020-05-19 14:32:38

"This is an absolutely great app and it beats out other fitness apps if you're willing to cough up the dough. It's cheaper than the gym and the team makes it worth your while. Although...I'm starting to hate Da Rulk (my legs are gone)...just kidding it's all great. One tip to the dev team though, would be to allow for budgets on the recipes. Ofc you can't account for the ingredients globally, but a ""budget"", ""normal"" ""fancy"" option would go a long way. But all in all, recipes are tasty. Kudos!",4,0,2020-06-09 16:15:10
"I was a personal trainer for a few years and this app is by far the best training app I've used. The recipes are great, the tracking is great, and the programs are thoughtful.

"Love it. I joined on a free trial fully expecting to cancel and instead signed up for a year. Great variety on workouts and some killer recipes. I thought it'd just be a quarantine fix but I genuinely look forward to my workouts on here on top of my time at the Iron Temple. I've done one 6 week challenge and on the second. Coming off knee surgery and can see leg muscles for the first time in awhile! Thanks for a great (and continually improving) product, Centr Team!",5,5,2020-06-20 03:19:57
"I absolutely love it! At first some of the workouts were hard for me because I was out of shape, but I started to feel stronger as I continued. Workouts are short with the longest being maybe 30 minutes. Super easy to fit into my day. Even love the meditation. I just havent tried the meal plans yet because grocery stores are crazy right now. I decided to continue the app after the free trial period because it has brought great value to my life and health. It is worth it.",5,2,2020-05-23 22:30:55
"As others have mentioned, this is a complete scam. I should've read these reviews before installing the app. Here is what happened to me: - I installed the app less than 2 hours ago - Through the entire setup process, it said I get started on a 7-day trial period. - It forced a subscription plan selection and still mentioned that I'll only be charged 7 days later. - I selected one and It charged me immediately. I can also see the charge deducted on my credit card. - I have been trying to connect with customer support but they finally sent me a flat ""cannot refund"" notice, stating that I might've done an accidental purchase. Also, they don't really read any of your grievances, they just write the standard response. They're refusing to understand that the app has a problem. DO NOT INSTALL THIS APP.",1,78,2022-03-18 04:20:18

"App overall is decent. The recipes are nice and fresh, the meditation i found was very good and the workouts will definitely tire you. However if you do not have home equipment or a gym it is really hard to do most of the workouts. There are barely any substitution exercises for everyone without equipment. It will get you in a decent shape but you do not learn a lot form it except to do what you are told. It's decent but you can learn a lot more from youtube for free. A bit of a letdown tbf.",3,21,2020-03-23 08:56:50
"Great for providing daily structure and motivation when WFH. Ad-free (as expected for a paid sub!). Customer support quick to engage when needed and very friendly/helpful. App does have some technical issues and could use a few enhancements, but as above, support team assist quicky and take feedback on board. An absolute wealth of information and programmes, so looks like I'll be busy for a while... Let's hope to see results!",4,13,2023-02-09 13:32:01
"Great app. Only thing that stops it being perfect is lack of range choices of style of training, and it can be hard to find a workout of specific things (e.g if you want to do a back muscle building day, a large list of workouts come up, but when u look at them they are all the same!)",4,1,2023-01-05 23:30:38
"I like the wide range of workouts, meditations and fitness articles available. I've found plenty of challenging and engaging workouts in the year that I have been subscribed. They do a good job of providing lower impact variations if you need those adjustments. As with many app based programs moving from lower intensity workouts to higher ones can be challenging as the difficulty can spike a bit but modifying and adding rest to the higher level workouts until you adapt can get you through.",5,3,2022-05-18 16:19:17
"Definitely like a personal trainer, you log on and the app tells you exactly what workout you'll be doing that day. Many times it's something unusual and that makes it fun. I like that I don't have to scroll through pages of pre-recorded workouts and choose and guess what's best. It's very customizable, though, if something doesn't work for you. Haven't tried many of the recipes but they look great, it's just nice to have my healthy day laid out for me as a checklist.",5,11,2020-04-20 22:40:33

Love the mix of workouts. The part where you can bump up or down the difficulty of each workout on the fly is amazing. I don't really follow the diet they provide because I really just don't have the time. But I can at least base my meals on something similar. Overall I have been in it for two months and I love the program!,5,1,2020-04-04 23:25:11
A great app for all fitness levels. I chose intermediate strength training as I last did weight training 2 years ago. Found some exercises too hard for my fitness level. I should of started on beginner and worked back to my previous strength. Love the app as it has a small video at the top of each exercise to show the correct movement. I will continue to use it past the the 10 week program.,5,9,2022-03-12 00:44:17
"Short guided workouts of 30 to 40 minutes, fun rotating exercises to keep you interested and not get bored. You get to pick the programs that suit your abilities along with meals and mindful practices. The best thing is I don't have to leave my home or have tons of exercise equipment. I can follow on my phone or cast to my TV.",5,8,2022-09-20 21:28:05
Really well done app that is very functional. The grocery list function is invaluable for meal prep. Workouts are great and presented well. It's rare that I come across apps that I absolutely love from a user perspective but this is one for sure. The Centr program is also incredible. Best out there of the holistic fitness programs in my opinion. Keep up the good work,5,23,2021-10-08 23:51:14
"The workout is very scattered. There is no balance at all. Many of the workouts have unequal reps and there is one that only did the left side but no right side. It's hard to focus or follow through. The recipe look easy enough, but I have not yet tried. I won't renew after a free trial though.",1,17,2021-01-20 02:42:48
The app is nice with a lot of different workouts. But the cancellation is very convoluted. I was sure that I cancelled my subscription (clicked cancel 2 or 3 times) but suddenly I was charged for the next 3 months. Apparently I didn't finish my cancellation and now I just lost 50 euros. Update: I've reached out by email twice before writing the review. The answer was the same: I haven't cancel on time so Centr will not return 50 euros. Support is mostly bots there.,1,18,2023-02-08 05:27:31
Been using Centr since its beginning! I love the fact that there are all kinds of workouts with different types of trainers. The recipes are really good and I appreciate that most of them are quick to make. I love when they introduce special programs to mix things up and I enjoy reading the different articles they publish concerning overall health. Wonderful app!,5,0,2020-06-11 14:43:27
"I wasnt able use it based off of not having time because of isolation....I know ironic. I cancelled days ago and was still charged even though my trial is until June 10th. Im confused. On top of that I can not find an option to cancel so i wont continue to get charged. I can even find a help option. Not sure if my issues are due to using a mobile browser but either way YIKES. Im sure this promotion was issued with the best of intentions. Make sure youre ready before you accept a ""Free"" trial",1,4,2020-05-17 20:52:32
"The content of the app is great but the app(developer) itself is horrible, the app keeps on crashing. I had to wait for 2 hours from the app not to drop the dumbbells. I couldn't workout when I wanted to workout. App developer is horrible. It has been 2 days and it keeps on crashing. Don't use the app, because it keeps on dropping the dumbells everytime you open it.",1,5,2021-05-13 13:47:30
"If you buy the yearly, that's basically $10/month, which is cheaper than my gym. The coaches are encouraging and so nice in the videos so I don't feel embarrassed or discouraged and the recipes are actually delicious (I expected kale smoothies for every meal, but there's a bunch of meals I'd regularly eat). It also has meditation sounds and a grocery shopping list so honestly, if they just added a period tracker and dentist reminders, this app could basically be a guide to adulting 😂",5,42,2022-08-16 00:03:51
I actually love this app but its not working correctly right now. On my tablet the app freezes whenever I start a workout. The vidoes won't play and the whole app freezes up. Also it won't switch from vertical mode to horizontal mode. It should do this so the videos fill up the screen. Please fix this.,3,1,2020-09-27 13:16:13
Tried the trial. Was not all that useful of an app. Be careful if you are waiting on a notification for the trial to be over. As they just run your card without warning for $100. My fault but most all the successful subscription based apps email you to warn you your subscription is up and they are about to run your card. I emailed them the same day they ran the card asking for a refund and cancelation. They said I was out of luck and refered me to the billing terms that I agreed to.,4,8,2020-05-14 03:40:09
"I do not have enough good words to properly express how much I love this app! The food options are delicious and easy to cook and filling, the workouts are varied and led by incredible instructors, and the meditations have really helped me decrease my stress levels. I recommend this to everyone I know!",5,1,2021-09-11 16:49:53
I'd like more programmes for advanced. You can only really do Centr Unleashed. Otherwise you have to sort of chop and change in the explore section. But the sheer range of content available by far makes it the most superior fitness app available. I was using freeletics before this and it just became too monotonous.,5,7,2021-05-10 11:27:25
I love the broad functionality. Whatever you feel like doing or eating there are heaps of options. You can wing it on your own or join a program. They really understand how variable some people are when it comes to exercise. I also like that they don't pester me or make me feel bad / pressure me. It's like a smorgasbord laid out - you choose how and when you use it.,5,8,2020-08-24 07:07:56
"Great content but currently having issues casting to my TV. Some workouts cast and others don't. I hope this is resolved soon, it's very convenient to cast to my TV. It was working fine before on Da Rulks workouts now halfway through intermediate it's not casting.",4,2,2023-04-14 19:27:37
"This app is well put together. Better than I thought. I originally joined for guided meditations and decided to try workouts. Workouts for every level,recipes, articles. The app has some glitches here and there but seem to get fixed quick. I highly recommend if you are looking for something for home or on the go!",5,0,2020-05-19 04:35:14
Loved the app but lately I can't even login without the app signing me out!!! So now I can't work out at all...,4,1,2023-08-27 21:30:15
"Whilst the app and content is pretty good, the customer service is shocking. Absolutely no prior notice of renewal (you're supposed to remember the date for 12 months) and no time period post auto renewal where you are allowed to cancel. I haven't used for 6 months but they renewed without letting me know beforehand and now refusing to refund me. Taking £100 for a service that I don't want and happy to do so because it says in the Ts&Cs. Very poor customer care!",1,40,2022-02-15 10:36:22
"Good quality of workouts are here. I like the coach sessions, it makes the difference. Weekly plan sounds good, hard one. If you find the weekly plan is hard, check out the 6 weeks programs. You can see beginner, intermediate, advanced in the same time in the 6weeks program. Keep up the good work, don't disappoint me, please:)",5,13,2020-09-28 19:05:47
"Good combination of exercise, stretching, meditation and nutrition. Definitely worth trying the free trial, I bought a subscription for one year and so far it's helping me stay interested and engaged. Don't buy into the Chris Hemsworth sales pitch too much though. He is present for some workouts but it's the PTs that give this app value.",5,1,2020-05-10 09:34:00
"Lots of different types of workouts to suit all abilities and styles. Excellent meal selection too, it's usually difficult to find really good vegan meal plans. The only thing that I'd like to see is to be able to log your own work out if you've done one outside the use of the app.",5,13,2022-04-15 08:45:50
UPDATE - docked my review by a star. I originally loved the app but then the app changed their lifting regimine for the worse. The lifting routine is very repetitive - I don't think it's changer the work out in 2 months... Fantastic app! My boyfriend and I are huge fans of the strength building program. It includes a lot of supersetting and full body moves so you really get your heart pumping while lifting. burnout superset that you do 3x.,4,1,2021-01-17 05:51:53
"Room for improvement- I have used several different fitness streaming apps. While I would rate the variety workouts and features of Centr a 5 out of 5, there are definitely areas the program can approve upon. 1. A built in cast feature like YouTube would be nice 2. Workouts could be more fluid. (I.e. not separate videos for warm up, workout and cool down) 3. Several workouts assume you know how to do each move, more instructional workouts would be nice.",4,0,2020-05-25 20:49:26
"really positive experience so far. coached courses are varied and fit into my schedule. meditation and mindfulness resources is a really nice touch. food recommendations look good, but I haven't tried them. the recommended shopping list (based on the recommended meals) is an excellent choice",5,5,2021-02-02 20:00:39
"App works well, but could go for some improvements. I'd like to be able to build custom playlists for workouts that would auto play one after the other for example, or some kind of offline mode. All in all it works well, and I use it almost every day.",4,0,2022-08-10 01:54:01
"This app is fantastic. The variety of the workouts, the simplicity and deliciousness of the food and the incredibly supportive community - I really can't recommend this enough. The app works a lot better than the web version did for me and I've had no bugs or glitches at all. If you want to achieve your goals then you've come to the right place. Don't think about it, take the step and never look back!",5,15,2019-12-17 20:23:40
"Really good app only had it a few days but already found it really useful, only improvement would be to have a way of ticking off what you've done that day for workouts, meals ect. As then I could see the total of cabs and protein that I've eaten in a day and how many calories burnt. Basically a calorie tracker",5,0,2021-01-07 12:34:28
"I've had the app for over 3 months now and love it! The planner is tailored to your goals so all you have to do is follow it, no need to count calories or plan your own workouts! The workouts and meals are all very easy to swap out, and you really can't go wrong with any of the meals because they are all adjusted based on your goals. There is a huge variety of workout options, from no-equipment to full gym access, and tons of well written articles regarding wellness. Definitely worth the price!",5,23,2021-01-23 21:17:07
"Great app. The shopping list is phenomenal especially when determining food for however many days of the week. The only downfalls I'd say are that there's no link to Samsung health which would be great, it needs an option to put in the food you have in your Fridge and potential meal options from there and I believe each time you do eat a meal it should track your overall intake for the day along with your workout output. Hence why attaching to Samsung health would be a huge add on.",5,10,2023-03-13 06:02:08
"So many different programs for so many different types of people no matter your stage. Gives good idea for meal preps and meals in general. I highly recommend to anyone. The food can be a pain to shop for, but i focused on what meals I needed help with. For me it was breakfasts. Getting away from cereal and eating healthier. So many god things to say about this app. Also has good music during workouts!",5,8,2021-06-29 05:19:19
Great way to stay on top of my health. Love the recipes. The exercises are great and I love the variation provided by the numerous trainers and training type. Having the workout plan taking care of and sent to me makes each new workout unique and fun. Takes some time to get used to some moves as there could be more to coach you into it... But it's been a great lifestyle app for me.,5,5,2022-04-02 21:59:28
"Lost a lot of money to this app, did the 7 day free trial and thought I had unsubscribed. I was instead charged monthly subscriptions with no email notification of this. Customer service pretty poor. From reading the reviews seems like a lot of people have experienced the same. Great business set up to get their money but very poor when it comes to being a customer.",1,6,2022-07-21 10:53:30
"This program is amazing. I am feeling the burn immediately and it covered all levels of fitness (beginner to advanced). It's engaging and easy to follow. Keeps my focus on the prize. As a diabetic, the nutritional information in the planner section helps me manage my diabetes accurately to keep me on track with eating properly for optimal muscle building/fat reductions.",5,6,2021-01-20 15:29:04
"This app is fantastic. Pretty cost effective, given it provides a huge range of receipes, workouts & meditation, a high level program based on your aims & knowledge to help you with your goals. It keeps me accountable without being overbearing. The receipes are easy, use simple & repeative ingredients & are actually delicious. I'm on the vegetarian diet & it makes it easier to find healthy food & be balanced. Only suggestion would be to save receipes externally to the app or save meat options.",5,11,2021-03-27 03:57:45
"I'm really enjoying this app, it's the best one for me to stick to and feel healthy, not obsessed, over. But I have some suggestions : - option to add a snack to your daily planner, the snack / treat recipes are great but i forget them. - swap daily mediation. - option to have 'jog outside' or 'other workout' swap (similar to how you have 'leftovers' as a meal swap) - More yoga - cheaper (i can't afford it right now) - stop suggesting same 'reads' It would be perfect then!",3,1,2020-04-09 08:37:25
"I would love to try this app, unfortunately I cannot get past the initial payment screen. It says there is a server issue when I try to change the form of payment, and also freezes when I try to move forward without changing other payment. I've also uninstalled then reinstalled the app but had the same experience. Using a Google pixel 5.",1,3,2022-05-31 11:31:43
Workouts are great and the app is very easy to use but my only complaint is that sometimes the videos do not load. I thought it was my internet connection but when I log into centr over the web it all of a sudden runs smoothly with no problems. Hopefully I am not the only person having trouble with the videos loading on the app and hopefully it will be fixed in an upcoming update. If my problem is fixed or someone informs me on what I may be doing wrong then I will change my review to a 5 star.,4,1,2020-04-29 05:15:32
"Update, some of the servings are massive! The quinoa, chickpea and sweet potato Buddha bowl for example after having moved the toggle to single serving, it' suggests the following; 400g of sweet potato Half a tin of chickpeas 90g of quinoa ect, That particular meal was an absolute effort to get through, but it wasn't the only one, these portions are huge and I'm always full! Cant even get to the snacks, also it was super dry and starchy too even with more than the recommended amount of dressing",2,12,2021-01-14 08:06:42
"Recommended for any level, and absolutely giving results. All you need is a little discipline (to actually follow the routines and stick to your chosen program) At the moment I'm on second week, Unleashed workout, advanced level, shown results already. The combination of workouts for beginners, intermediate and advanced, with or whitout equipment, perfectly timed for each level. The bonuses: meals & mental health, stretching aso, makes it a complete workout& wellness App, worth every penny.",5,1,2020-12-07 21:54:20
"Really like the app but I'm having trouble with video playback for the workouts. They initially work fine when I start my daily workout but as I progress to different exercises they simply stop loading and continually spin a loading circle. I'm on fibe internet over wifi with no issues loading anything in other apps. Tried cellular and got the same result, even low data modes don't allow it to load. Not sure if it's specifically my device but I have a OnePlus 7 pro, Android 12.",4,3,2023-01-12 01:44:02
I remembered that I cancelled earlier but seems like it wasn't because apparently I was charged later on. When I wrote in to seek for help they just told me t&c says no refund available. This is the first subscription I ever heard that refuse to refund when I clearly refuse to use the services anymore. Very disappointed.,1,3,2023-04-08 02:39:52
"Lots of options. The app has definitely developed quite a bit over this first year. The meals are pretty yummy and balanced. I wish it was on apple tv so I could see the picture bigger than just on my phone, but seeing that they have really expanded the app this past year, I hope this will come soon. I reordered it for next year too.",5,1,2021-05-06 09:53:57
"The workouts are amazing and the app tailors to your needs so easily. But the meals the meals is where it's at. Again tailored to your needs whether you're vegan, veggie, eat meat or only fish etc etc.. The meals uper tasty, so much variation, nothing too complicated but nothing tastes simple. Outstanding work making an incredible app.",5,14,2021-03-10 16:08:13
The best workout sessions I ever haved in my fitness journey.,5,1,2023-09-13 13:45:43
Expensive for what you get. They say their costs are cheap as an alternative to having a PT but there is plenty of information online that is free and more extensive. App does seem to be well built and looks nice. My self and many others according to reviews have had issues with being charged without notification of renewal of subscription or have had issues cancelling our subscription,2,1,2021-10-28 04:00:59
"I've had the app for a couple of days (currently on 7 day trial period) and have been enjoying the workouts that are available. Initial plan was to get a yearly subscription, but after reading the comments on here about their auto renewal and lack of support or refund for their customers, I have cancelled and taken screenshots to be on the safe side. Its a shame as I said I was enjoying the workouts but I can't subscribe with a company that treats it's customers that way.",3,25,2023-03-06 15:51:57
"Bad customer service. They made the mistake of taking my funds out early for an annual subscription. After asking them politely if I could change to a monthly, they did nothing to make me feel as if they cared. After realising they made a mistake by taking the funds early, they refunded me. I would have kept my subscription but after experiencing their customer service team i've happily cancelled for good. Hopefully Amazon's acquisition fixes their customer service team.",1,0,2022-12-11 19:03:19

"I have a Google Pixel and for some reason the user interface just isn't as intuitive, and I'm missing the ""explore"" tab that is accessible on the webpage. As someone who won't realistically work out every single day, the daily planner is not a useful format to me. I would be interested to stay on if we could fix this so pixel users can access the ""explore tab"" :) Also would LOVE to be able to star favourite workouts",3,10,2020-03-24 11:34:19
"Was a great app and service, until I tried to cancel and would constantly send me in circles to the sign up page (even though I was already signed up) and would then say to cancel my subscription through Google play (was not coming up on my subscription list) so I have now been charged for the subscription that I cannot afford and still no closer to unsubscribing and claiming a refund. Massive let down.",1,17,2020-05-13 11:42:19
"Great app. Worth it. The coached sessions are really helpful. The meals plans also give great ideas. Although I did think it was a little sneaky how they advertised it as $* per month, then after I signed up I was charged for the whole year.",5,1,2020-07-07 21:07:51
"Awful. Tutorials can only be streamed. Other fitness apps allow you to download routines so when you don't have WiFi/data (i.e. in my gym), you can still play them. Centr doesn't have this feature but prices itself as a premium app. The lunch meal plans are ""leftovers"" even though I turned that option off. Customer service are arrogantly uninterested. Had to repeat myself as they don't read emails properly. Frustrating and unpleasant experience. Charged for a year, but refuse any part refund.",1,23,2022-04-14 21:29:52
"Great! Workouts are great and can be customized. Same goes for food, best meals I've ever cooked and they seem to have gotten smarter about using grocery items on several meals in one week. Great for when I'm on the move too, jist look for no equipment needed exercises.",5,0,2020-05-15 23:57:32

"Great for beginners. Always encouraging as you go. More than just work outs too. Meal plans, guided work outs, self paced work outs. Super awesome to help keep me on track. What I love the most is the new 6 week program. The exercises are split up into 2 sets and it has a rest between each exercise and each set. It helps me stay with it and get through the whole workout. Plus they offer modifications to the exercises. Been going strong for 2 weeks straight everyday and am seeing results.",5,6,2020-06-06 01:52:48
"Really love the recipes and the list building that's possible. Plus, swapping out depending on ingredients works great. The exercises are also solid though we keep swapping out because we have no bag or bench as some call for. Bodyweight and dumbbell are keeping us going with pilates moves as well. Can't wait for both of us to look like Chris!!",4,3,2020-09-17 02:19:03
"This app makes working out easy and enjoyable. There are so many different programs and ways to work out that it never gets dull. There are delicious healthy recipes and you can save those along with your favorite workouts. I am seeing results and feeling a lot better thanks to centr.

I would absolutely recommend this app to anyone and everyone, it doesn't matter if you're a beginner or advanced, you'll want to go back for more.",5,1,2020-02-14 07:33:55
Excellent workouts with loads of variety. Go to try out new exercises and found some I really enjoy. Haven't got past intermediate yet but really enjoying it.

"Amazing app! Within a month theres was a big difference in my physique, the workouts are always good and mixed combing different methods of gym activities for muscles.

Love this app. So much in it! There are such a vast range of trainers and also you can change the difficulty level which means I could start easy and work my way up. I haven't even used it to it's full potential and it's still the first time I've ever done exercise 6 days a week and enjoyed it. Highly recommend.,5,7,2021-12-08 21:45:43
"Great app! I love all the options on the different workouts, and have finally started do yoga after years of telling myself I would. The only reason I didn't give five stars is because i found the weight training workouts wanting. Even the Centr Power program didn't really meet my needs as an athlete. I had to make a few modifications to actually make it a ""power"" workout. With a few tweaks it was a killer program. I think this is a great app for the vast majority of people using it.",4,12,2021-08-26 23:10:19
"What a wonderful app to use for at home workouts! Definitely gave me options of more bodyweight moves to keep in shape and cross train with. The yoga and meditation options are a HUGE plus. Coming from a Wellness background this is not just a fitness app, but an entire wellness program touching on physical activity, nutrition, sleep aids and mental health. A sincere thanks to Chris and your team for being so generous with your program during COVID19.",5,16,2020-08-26 17:43:28

I just got one remark though, if only our capable coaches recorded the whole workout rather than individual exercises, that would be more motivating and more engaging as we see them suffer and sweat with us instead of keep pushing us from the comfort of the studio, I found myself repeating their commentary as it comes with each exercise. Bring said that, I will always give it 5 stars.",5,4,2020-09-19 10:16:05
"By far the best training app I've found, that might be biased considering this is the only app I've ever downloaded like this but it gets me up every morning into a routine for success. For anyone that is wanting to work out that doesn't know how, this will get you started from begginer to advanced & get you into the routine of consistency, & that's what really matters to make change in your life.",5,2,2020-07-12 10:25:34
"This app has been amazing! I love following the quality workouts that are doable and motivating. I love the versatility of the workouts too, from yoga to slow it down, to high intensity interval training. The recipes are high quality as well. They offer programs and I've used everything on this app. Well worth the money.",5,1,2020-06-10 11:13:07
"Amazing! So easy to follow, lots of options for fitness level to help you achieve your goals. Meals are pretty yummy. Make sure you utilize the snack options. I am 44 years old and have never been in better shape or felt healthier/stronger.",5,0,2020-07-04 14:07:16
"Amazing health and fitness plan. Within 4 weeks I have lost almost a stone, and been given a load of new recipes that now family favourites. The exercise plan is really easy to follow, with either a daily options or a six week programme to complete. And the mindful meditation/sleep meditations are amazing for my wellbeing. Well worth the subscription cost.",5,1,2020-05-10 14:26:52
"Great app. Very user friendly and easy to navigate. The recipes are delicious and have helped me to enjoy other flavors i would have never tried. They are great with workouts including modifications and turorials. Literally anyone can use this program whether its at a gym, in a home, or in an apartment. Love this app.",5,0,2022-07-30 12:14:56
This app is amazing. Unfortunately due to everything going in the world I can't afford the sub after the free trial is up. But definitely hoping to come back. The six week trial was amazing and a great thing to do for those stuck at home. Well done centr!,5,1,2020-04-29 23:15:03
I mostly just use the app for their workouts and I quite enjoy them. The newest 6-week program is off to a particularly good start. They also seem to be very responsive to feedback and consistently make improvements to the app.,5,0,2020-05-22 16:04:38
"Got this as a substitute for the Gym when everything was closed and a year costs 1/2 of what the monthly memborship was for us before. The fitness training I appreciate, but the meal plan is what sold me on the app. Granted it requires a LOT of ingredients, many of which aren't available here in Asia, but even without following it daily the resource for healthy menus, shopping list, and caloric information are extremely helpful. I would hust appreciate a ""favorites"" tab to save our favorites.",5,0,2020-06-12 02:23:11
"Fantastic app with great workouts. Only thing I'd like to see is an option to switch between body weight workouts and some with more equipment that I can do at the gym (when they open). Regardless, all round great app.",5,0,2020-05-21 21:54:43
"Tried a few fitness apps, this is by far my favourite. Really customisable to my fitness level and the fitness goals im targeting. Loads of led sessions which i respond to well. I can have lower back issues from years of heavy lifting and twisting and Centr really helps support and strengthen my back and core. Brilliant variety, lots of fun while working hard. Loads of food plans too. Love it!",5,1,2022-02-09 11:01:16
I joined centr when it was first launched with just the website access. I was so excited to have the ability to have a workout plan designed for my specific needs. I have been loving the meal plans associated with the app. So many delicious recipes. Being able to filter the workouts by equipment availability is incredibly helpful. I wish you could filter the meal plan by major ingredients as well (maybe one day!) So thankful for this app.,5,10,2020-02-15 02:22:15
"Love the app.Great workouts for all levels of expertise, only trouble is the need to have at least some basic workout equipments at home.Hope that the gyms open up soon so that i can do this with more weights.What i love most is the meal guide and sleep meditations.So many options to choose from and everything is ready to make, healthy and tasty.i thought the sleep meditations would be silly but they were super effective. I fall asleep by the time the meditation is over. Definitely worth buying.",5,2,2021-02-20 20:21:25
"Wow! What a great app! I haven't done anything fitness before, I didn't even cook, wasn't into nutrition and then I decided to make a change. Thank goodness for Centr! It has everything in one place, the workouts, meal plans and meditation, it's also personalised to my goals. After just 4 weeks I can already see progress in my muscle - I can see it 😆 Love the vibe of the trainers and the variety of both the workouts (it doesn't get boring) and the recipes (I'm a veggie and I'm really impressed)",5,3,2022-02-06 16:16:59
The Best App on the planet ..have tried many other apps and even have had many pts over the years but have never had a transformation as good as I've had while using the app ..everything is so well organized and explained the forms the exercises programs functional circuits and even the meals..Great trainers as well and almost all forms of exercises are available..Great Work Centr team keep it up ..,5,11,2021-11-26 19:00:08
"Workouts are great so far. The app is well designed in it's layout, but it doesn't work well. I've had to reinstall it a couple times now and now it won't let me log in. Really inconvenient when I'm trying to workout.",3,1,2020-03-24 20:59:09
"Work outs are great, but the video must be running the whole time. Not convenient for use at a busy gym. It would be better if there were audio only circuit timers available to say when to switch without having the video run the whole time.",3,4,2020-01-23 16:04:30
"I found this to be a very good app with regards to the explanations and videos. There are however a few things I would like to see added. downloading the videos would be useful to stop buffering in low speed areas,. Adding weight and height would also be helpful when it comes to the daily food intake. I am currently 130kg looking to loose body fat, the food plan given for the day would put me in such a huge defeceit that it would not sustainable. Please add these features and I can give 5 stars",3,14,2019-12-29 09:29:35
"This program is AWESOME. I've been doing Centr6 for a week, and following the meal plan as close as I can - and it's been great! The exercises are demonstrated well, and in various stages of difficulty for those not so inclined to working out. On top of the app, the Facebook community is great and supportive. Very excited for the coming addition of Unleashed, and for what the future holds. Thanks!",5,12,2020-05-12 18:57:18
"This app is super user friendly. I've had it downloaded for a while just never used it until the Rona happened and traditional gyms were closed. I am so happy with the no equipment workouts that I cancelled my membership when I can get an actual coached workout filter for what I'd like to do at home. Plus the coaches seem super down to earth so that's rad. Have not messed with the nutrition part yet, though v",5,0,2020-06-06 04:44:27
"BEWARE. My annual subscription autorenewed with no warning or notification. I made contact on the day it was due to renew to say I didn't want it to and was basically told ""tough"". NOT GOOD ENOUGH. In general I found the whole programme quite boring and over reliant on repackaging / randomly generated workouts and hadn't used it at all for 6 months...",1,40,2021-05-06 12:47:43
"Fabolous app. Love the food, so tasty, nutritious and accessible. The fitness programmes are engaging, superb trainers. Also the programme variety, both with and without equipment, stretching, good instructions from beginners through to advance. Calming meditation, good advice and also the app is updating with new programme. Yes, am liking the app, glad I found it.",5,6,2022-02-10 08:09:14
Workouts are solid; I'm meeting my goals. The app itself needs some work. The videos go black midway through a workout which requires me to fiddle with the app. I've reported it to them but it's been months without a fix.,3,5,2020-08-29 18:14:24
"incredible app, chris and his team have done an excellent job creating this. The workouts are amazing and are very easy to follow and pick up, dont have to be a brain box to figure them out, its instructed amazing and deep the motivation and push from the team to keep pushing. Feels like I'm in the room with you guys, would love a in person workout with the team. THANK YOU CENTR",5,1,2020-04-11 12:04:52
Ive got 2 boys and I find It hard to get motivated and to designate some time for myself. Then this app came across Facebook and I though I'll give it a try! I've just started my 3rd wk of the 10wk intermediate muscle building program and It's great! Ive really noticed changes and I'm already getting some definition. I love having each session laid out and timed with the movement video so its easy to smash out quick. And the recipes are awesome. 10/10 recommend!,5,5,2021-12-19 08:41:48
"I'm going to keep trying it through these next 6 weeks, but I think it would be a good app for those attempting to lose weight or stay tone. If you are trying to build muscle, I'm not sure if just the standard selection of daily workouts will get you there. You'll likely need to focus on one trainer's workouts. Some of the muscle building workouts don't talk during the workout to give tips on the intensity to shoot for. It'd be great to get a Hemsworth intro on some workouts he tried.",3,21,2020-04-05 04:13:29
"I enjoy the layouts of the programs and appreciate that I can do most at home with dumbells. I am definitely seeing gains even with the 30 minute sessions. I like that the new release is a home weight training program with active recovery days. My one, very large complaint is that the workouts are not real time. I would love for the trainers to do the whole workout with you, instead of performing the move twice and then looping it with a cheesy commentary overlay. PS more Tahl! ❤️",4,0,2022-07-12 17:06:21
"I have not taken advantage of the full program yet, but the exercise portion is great. I did centr unleashes for six weeks and am now doing a more strength oriented program. The coaches are great, the modifications are explained well. I love it.",5,1,2021-02-11 01:12:45
"I've been using this app for a while now and I love it! The app is outstanding and very easy to use. You can have access to wide range of workouts, meal plans, ans super hero world class coaching for a very reasonable price. It great to have the option of coached or Self-Guided workouts. Strongly recommend! 👌 Go for it! Love Chris a million , but I will just keep calling him Thor anyway 😍",5,15,2019-12-31 04:28:34
"The workouts are repetitive, that's why I've stopped using the app shortly. Also I've renewed by mistake for another year and 2 mins later I've contacted the team and ask for a refund which was denied for some bs reason. When you login from mobile the only option you have is to renew and I accidentally press the button, it seems like it was placed on purpose and I find ridiculous that won't refund money after making a mistake and not using the product. Too greedy for money. What a scam",1,2,2023-02-19 23:04:38
"Excellent fitness/personal development app! It has numerous valuable information on diets, lifetsyle, recipes and many more! The app is simple to use. I do have a few feedback: * Servings - Does one serving equate to one portion per meal? *Dark Mode - Is there any chance that the app could be optimised with the phone's dark mode? Otherwise this is an ex app!",5,7,2020-12-31 02:02:30
"This app makes working out incredibly easy and accessible. It is also extremely affordable, especially if you get the annual membership. The workouts are great and the meal plans are also fantastic. Sometimes I substitute recipes if I don't have the right ingredients or not in the mood for that particular meal. There is also a wide variety of snacks to choose from which really helps! Overall, the whole things feels very prefoessional and luxurious without costings a fortune! 10/10.",5,2,2023-01-02 17:49:07
"Crashes every time I click ""log in"". The content itself (in the browser version) is nice, but seriously, if you're charging for subscribtion at least develop a working app, so people will have a proper experience. I guess they just developed this for iOS and tried to just port it for Android, instead of actually developing an app.",1,28,2020-01-30 10:14:19
"App is fine. However, I'm frustrated that this app is categorized as ""free"" when it requires a subscription just to open. A free trial shouldn't put this as a ""top free"" app. Whether or not it's worth it isn't the point; I just regret that I wasted my time believing that some features wouldn't require a subscription.",2,0,2022-12-18 05:42:16
"I'm so excited for the app since I joined Centr as a founding member! It's sleek and convenient, and I don't keep getting signed out for no reason. Just one thing I wish I still have from the web version however is the shopping list page to be able to select a saved recipe to see individual ingredients and adjust quantity. Other than that, I'm thrilled to continue my fitness journey with you. It has changed my life for sure.",5,10,2020-01-02 03:04:44
"I love this app. You can have a guided tour or forge your own path. All while having complete workouts and amazing recipes. Not to mention it's affordable. Extremely affordable, however you still have to put the effort in. Gotta have a little skin in the game.👏",5,0,2022-10-11 10:51:24
"EDIT: In response to the developer's response, I know how a free trial works. My point was - I believe you may have missed it - is that you were not transparent with that fact that this is a subscription service. Additionally, having to remember to cancel for a subscription can be tedious, and if I forget to cancel, I'm left with a bill and an app I paid for that I may not use. And this whole time they advertise it as if it is free...the only thing you'll get free of charge is a 7 day trial.",1,58,2020-09-04 07:06:26
"A Founding Member of Centr. It keeps growing in workout options ie beginner to advanced, coached or uncoached. Keeps getting better with improvements, it has an enormous range of fitness avenues / coaches and eating choices, meditations and all in all, keeps guiding and supporting you further and further towards the healthy you. Also, has its own community which members also offer support and progress reports that people share to others of own achievements and that helps to motivate all. Vern.",5,0,2020-10-20 00:01:19
"I've had this for a couple of months now, and have found both the meal plans and exercise options to be fantastic. There is a lot of variety in the meal plane of that's what you want, but the meals are also very easy to scale up using their servings tool so if you prefer to prep bulk meals in advance you can. There's also a fab community of users on Facebook that members can join for tips and advice and generally for keeping each other motivated!",5,6,2021-01-11 07:22:04
"I bought this as a founder (before it was released) and have kept my membership for a reason. The different kinds of workouts, combined with the quality in each kind is amazing, and the recipes with it AND guided meditation is priceless. I would pay three times the amount I do because it would still be worth it.",5,18,2021-08-24 22:00:51
"Great workouts! Plus honestly, giving free 6 week access due to the pandemic was an amazing (and smart!) gesture! I quickly fell in love with the workouts (and trainers!!) and didn't hesitate to subscribe when the time came. Also a great value for what you get!!",5,0,2020-05-30 14:07:10
"I have been using this app for two weeks. I like it; it is easy to use and to follow the instruction. Many information and different types of guidance provided. ( nutrition, meditation, work out and more..) I didn't explore everything yet, but 6-week bodyweight program it's fantastic, Luke and Ashley are the best.",5,1,2020-07-19 00:16:26
"The best workout app I have ever used and I have used a few! Have subscribed to the 3 monthly payment and it still just seems so cheap for the content you are getting! In about 5 minutes (and that's me trying to decide what to eat as there is so much on offer) I can plan out my entire weeks with workouts, meals and meditations! Delete every other workout app you have just get this. You won't regret it when you see the results after a month or 2!!",5,21,2021-10-07 08:32:37
"I'm in my second week of having the app and I already notice a marked improvement in physical health and fitness. The recipes make eating vegan enjoyable and easy. Every meal is to prepare and delicious. The workout programs are intense, but I feel like the results will be incredible.",5,0,2022-05-05 22:39:15
"So far so good. The workouts target a variety of muscle groups, the trainers are all very experienced. The meals take quite a bit of time to make and buying the ingredients is time consuming so I just use this for the workouts. The meals look delicious though.",4,0,2020-07-09 09:03:15
"Great app started back in mid December, I have currently lost around 30 pounds. They are always listening to the community (especially on their facebook, join if you havent). This app has not only helped me become healthy but I've also lost a few medical conditions I've had for a while do to the meals and workouts. Great community great instructors, and many new friends.",5,1,2020-04-11 21:06:58
"Love the app. It is apprehensive with meditations, recipes, and many different kinds of workouts and programs. I've had it for 4 months before really utilizing it and I don't know what I was thinking! Highly recommend it.",5,0,2020-05-30 18:12:15
"I would advise caution with this app. If you go over your free trail period (even by a few hours) you will be stung by a full annual fee. Customer Service is not great either, they are nameless and BOT like responses; forget ever trying to enter any talks about refunds. In the end their customer service becomes unresponsive which I feel is rude and unprofessional. I wish I had avoided this app altogether, their payment strategy and customer service needs a great deal of improvement.",1,44,2021-03-02 07:22:10
Great program overall. I really like having so many options for workouts when I want to change up the activities in the planner. Would be nice if I could look back at what workouts I have completed though. With so many options it's hard finding a specific workout after it disappears from the planner.,4,15,2020-12-15 21:06:42
"I'm not big on the recipes because the food is nothing I normally keep in my fridge or pantry. Searching for recipes I may like seems like a chore to add to a shopping cart/list. I like the guided functional fitness workouts and the guided mma/boxing workouts. My only gripe is that the combinations at times don't flow well with my fight style but it keeps me moving, works my coordination, and gets a good sweat going while I am stuck in lockdown and away from my fight team.",4,0,2020-06-02 01:25:48
"App is easy to use! Great Strength training workout! I'm sure the rest is good, too. I wish there was a way to add notes. The strength training workouts are set up for a gym (it tells you that). I'm working out at home, so use alternative moves in places. It would be nice if there was a way to note that. (If there is a way, I haven't figured it out). Also, a way to record extra exercises (if I want to add something additional to what's in the daily workout).",4,12,2021-12-18 14:13:53
"Amazing! Choose your goal, your level, your eating habits and you get a tailored fitness plan which also pays attention to mental health through podcasts and meditations. The variation is immense. You wont get bored. HIIT, HIRT, weighted, plyometric, pilates, functional training...something for every occasion. Im also vegan so to have meals suggested which werent just steak, chicken, egg and designed for me was great. Feel so much fitter, lost kilos, abs appearing. Constant new material as well",5,15,2020-10-05 11:15:55
This is far and away the best and most user friendly app for health and fitness i have come across!! The planner and layout is straightforward and the workouts are motivating with heaps of variety! The meals are like we have a restaurant in our house they are so full of flavour! The shopping list makes it really easy to be totally prepared!! Heaps of great tips and the meditations have become a ritual! Also the online community is so supportive and full of inspiration!! As are the Centr team!!!,5,2,2020-02-15 04:27:20
"Great app! I only follow the workouts and enjoy the articles and podcasts. The vegan recipes are good! I don't follow them daily but they give great suggestions. The workouts are really tough (advanced mode) but showing great results and are perfectly timed. None of these 1 hour+ home workouts, these are more like 20-45 mins ☺",5,1,2020-04-22 18:41:46
"Ever since the update the app keeps crashing, not loading, generally being annyoing. Do please fix it fast, as I very much enjoy the content and UI, but its difficult not to be frustrated when you re in the work out mindset and the app takes 10 minutes to work, only so it can crash shortly after",3,5,2020-02-12 17:05:59
"Only if the app was as good as the trainers, would be much better - 1) better way to integrate programs into the planner 2) I complete a 45 min session, but don't keep the screen on continually, so the length of the workout in Google Fit is incorrect 3) ability to extend the rest timer 4) ability to enter body stats 5) ability to sort list of searched workouts by time 6) one click access to currently enrolled programs from main screen 7) too many clicks to log weights",4,26,2022-06-07 05:29:01
"It is good apps , good content, but tracking and monitoring is not available. For example, you can not tell how many excerices you did last month , how many you skipped, was it better then the month before ... the apps just do excerices and I end up buying another apps and manually record my Centro excerices in it. They claim that it sync with Google fit, but it does not work very well.",1,13,2021-04-05 06:40:33
Well balanced workout app! Lots of different exercises and moves. Da Rulk is why we are all here (let's be honest) but the meal plan is a great bonus! Sometimes the food is hit or miss on the delicious scale so I'm excited whenever they add new stuff but I think this app will keep evolving so I really enjoy it! 60 day trial was pretty spectacular too! More apps should do this if they want customers. Edit: still here a couple years later. The Centr Power programs are phenomenal!,5,17,2022-11-15 14:01:14
"Great app, perfect for working out at home, or if I actually make it to the gym. I like the UI and has a decent variety of exercises. Id say the subscription fee is more than reasonable give the quality and content 🤙🏻",5,6,2020-01-03 04:05:56
"Centr is the complete package - from excellent workouts targeted to my goals, to improving sleep, diet and well-being. I'm a single father of two and I feel like I have more energy now than I have in a long time. The app is easy to use and everything is planned out on the daily planner. The shopping list feature for meal recipes is a great addition too.",5,16,2020-08-13 10:07:54
"Nothing short of AMAZING This app is like a personal trainer and nutritionist in your pocket. The meals are super tasty and the perfect nutritional value depending on what plan you're going for. The workout are challenging and there are so many to choose from, even yoga and pilates! The planner keeps you on track but if you're not a fan of a day you can always swap it for something you prefer. I haven't made a better investment in myself than this app 😍",5,3,2020-05-13 19:59:06
"The best work out and general health app that I've used. The work outs are easy to follow so I've been able to keep at it. The sleep meditations have helped me fall asleep on more than one occasion. Overall, just a brilliant app, and not because it has Chris Hemsworth on it. That's just an added bonus!",5,0,2020-12-22 22:17:30
"Great app from what I can tell from a few weeks using it. A ton of features and it's clearly a lifestyle change of you follow it 100%. Only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of five is due to the nutrition side. It would be nice to know that the app is doing calculated calories and macros for my specific age, weight, and activity level. A person's TDEE and adding/subtracting from that is a huge part of achieving goals. There just isn't any mention of it in this app or product.",4,17,2021-12-09 22:27:32
"Horrible Customer Service. I could not get my money back! Signed up for their free trial and then cancelled on the application. Thinking it was done, I was charged full year subscription. And their response was no read the terms and conditions. How many times do I have to cancel you crooks? Customer service should have empathy for people. Great job.",1,13,2021-05-23 20:20:47
It is not a diet program but lifestyle change. The meal plan alone is worth it. The meditation has me sleeping better and my stress levels have never been better. At only around $10 a month with the annual subscription it isn't a high cost either. I've been in the program for 6 weeks and have already lost 10 lbs and that is not being able to do all the workouts yet. The community that has developed from Centr is also so supportive and helpful. No matter what your fitness level this is for you.,5,0,2020-05-21 15:09:59
"It could be pricier than other apps..that are..well free, but the workouts are exceptional. Every one will end with you feeling like you made decent progress, making it that much more likely you will stick with it. This program doesn't post gimmicks and involves guided hard work!",5,0,2020-05-27 01:49:54
"This is my second year using the Centr app, it's worth every cent! I love all the options for types of exercise even though pilates is my everyday workout of choice, Sylvia is a wonderful instructor, I always use her coached workouts to be sure of correct form. To have such a comprehensive app that covers all aspects of health is fantastic! I have tried some of the recipes and enjoyed them, the sleep visualisation is well done, I appreciate that the app is always being added to. Excellent!",5,15,2021-07-20 21:10:22
This app gives everything that I could ever ask for. I love the workout programs and that they will offer low impact alternatives for their exercises. I feel like I have gotten more out of this than going to just a gym. Sleep meditations are great as well. You can follow them on social media if you're curious to what they have to offer.,5,0,2020-06-18 15:21:09
"The app is great, lots of workouts, meal ideas, calming tools, only con so far is the same warm up and cool down videos and the exercises are just a repeat of the first video for every set, I would have preferred the trainers to go through each rep. Otherwise, cool app.",4,0,2021-01-15 15:05:36
I don't recommend. Food meal plan is difficult to find ingredients often and expensive to follow. There's no option to switch out ingredients for meals and you can't set your preferences if you don't want certain ingredients to show up. Workouts are ok but you can get Workouts anywhere. There's nothing in the Workouts that makes this awesome.,2,14,2021-08-09 21:15:56
"I'm currently on week three of one of the many programmes. It has three area's that you choose from I.e tone, build muscle, get lean. The programmes vary from beginner, intermediate to advanced. The recipes are fantastic & new recipes are added weekly. I completed the Body Coach 90 days last year, however there's so much more to this app regarding physical & mental wellbeing. Well worth the money.",5,1,2021-01-08 17:09:30
really weird app. Doesn't work with a vpn which feels sketch. Have opted out of the mailing list three times now and they just keep coming. I personally don't think I'm the target market for a lot of the activities either-no idea why id need to visualise myself on a luxury yacht during a meditation in order to relax but I guess some people are into that.,2,100,2021-06-12 22:22:07
"Easy to use, navigate, follow and great Trainers! 12/09/21 - Volume does not work on self guided workouts, despite checking that volume for timers and everything else is switched on. Have uninstalled and reinstalled the app, but still doesn't work. This doesn't help when I'm not facing the screen as I have to stop my exercise to check! Sort it out Centr! 20/09/2021 - I have emailed Centr at the email address you have provided and await response! Can you adapt the app for Smart TVs?",5,17,2021-09-20 05:33:14
"Completely unethical company. I signed up for a year subscription, never used it. At some point the subscription was changed to an auto subscription. With no advanced warning that a charge was upcoming they charged over $100 for an app I never use. When notified that I do not want the app or the subscription, all I got was an email stating that it basically ""sucks to be you"". Terrible customer service. Stay far away from this app and this company.",1,3,2022-07-04 16:51:23
"The best workout app I've used. Been working out for 15 years and I've never been this destroyed during workouts. The videos are awesome, movements are precise, no extra fluff, straight to the point, warm ups and cool downs. Fun healthy meal options. Good job with this! This is literally for everyone.",5,25,2020-11-05 16:32:36
"Well-rounded with great expertise. I love how each trainer specialises in a certain fitness type, mental health or food prep! Seems to be endless workouts to choose from. Great energy from the trainers and options to adjust to your fitness level or equipment you have available. I havent found any bugs yet. Great job!",5,1,2020-04-20 08:33:50
"The best fitness app hands down! Has everything you could ever need between the multiple trainers, workout styles, and difficulty levels, to tasty recipes and mindfulness practices. I have had it since day 1 and can't imagine my life without it. 5 out of 5 stars.",5,0,2022-02-19 20:35:39
"The workouts are unbalanced and all over the place. I chose muscle building as my goal and I don't get a real balanced plan inluding all muscle groups. The recipes are great or at least most of them, but I think they could be a little more simple. Some of the ingredients you can't even find in normal supermarkets which is really annoying. And please stay away from the salted caramel oatmeal. It uses so much coconut milk that it gets disgustingly greasy. I couldn't even swallow 1/4 of it.",2,11,2021-02-03 08:55:01
"Absolutely could not live without this app! Between the fun, energetic, supportive work outs (from yoga to boxing) and the amazing food recipes, it has covered everything I've needed to make my life healthier, this is not a diet but a life style change. There's also meditation and daily articles to keep you on track too. Id never try another workout app again",5,2,2020-02-14 08:29:40
Amazing!!! I may still look like Fat Thor right now but everyday I'm improving with this awesome app! I've tried so many different fit app and have never stuck with them..this one however is just perfect. Workouts are fun and engaging without ever feeling too cringy! Lots to choose from and easy to use. Gotta have at least 1 criticism and thats I would like to see more keto options for meal ideas. Keep up the great work dudes! Dave xx,5,0,2022-04-22 16:42:28
It's all about money to them. I got charged even before concluding my 7day trial period and they do not consider even consider to investigate and offer refunds. It's by default not available in billing terms leaving users helpless. Although they say you can stop automatic renewals in the app it's no where to be found!! Absolutely horrible customer service and you should never trust a company running with one sided T&C for their benefit. Do not fall into their trap. DISGUSTING!!!,1,65,2021-11-03 01:17:38
"BEST WELLNESS APP EVER I heard about the program from a friend and got 6 weeks free. Honestly changed my life. Changed my perception of fitness and wellness. I saw results I wasn't expecting. I began to see results in ways I didn't think were possible. It's got personal trainers, its got food (amazing btw. I have yet to find a recipe I dont like after using it for several months.) It even has meditation! So worth it. If you're hesitating, bite the bullet and do it. You'll thank yourself.",5,0,2020-05-22 01:31:56
"Really great app, definitely helping me get in better shape! The awesome team really help keep you motivated and coming back for more. Big fan of Alexz and Luke as I've already finished beginner and am in intermediate unlimited now. Looking forward to challenging Da Rulk's masterclass in a couple months. Also don't let the diet plan phase you if you live on a budget like me, you could pick a few recipes and switch em out when you want. I've still had great results doing so. Thanks centr team!",5,1,2022-03-31 22:32:04
"Workouts, recipes, blog posts and the planner are all awesome. The app and service itself doesn't quite live up to their quality, it should have more ""programs"", a history log and weight and goal tracking to make it worth the price. Feels nearly there though.",4,1,2020-05-03 08:28:42
"I'm someone who has always been physically active, but not a serious gym goer. This app has not only made it extremely easy to follow your specific goals but makes it rewarding, fun and easy is very unique. Highly recommended over just about any other workout app. While year for $100? Almost to good to be true! P.S. No way you ca better smoothie recipes then this app! P.P.S logging weight/Rep is a little weird to get used to but in one session I've got it down to a science 👌",5,19,2021-07-15 00:41:09
"Centr has gotten me back in my excercise groove. I love the experience, the coaches, and how they have created a full service program. 6 week programs (I am in the beginner) and I am already feeling a difference. I love how they take you through both sets of the series instead of just telling you to do a 2nd set. And the coaches commentary is funny, inspiring and different each time. Love it.",5,7,2020-12-09 16:29:25
"Good content. Would be great to have the option of turning off the music in the workout videos so that I could listen to my own. The music is fine, but it gets a bit grindy listening to the same songs that play at the same intervals on each workout.",4,2,2021-09-27 04:39:54
The workouts are great. The meditation is a nice change of pace to my day. The meals are great. The only reason its not 5 stars is because I wish I could design my meal plan around a budget. Its very expensive to buy everything. And some ingredients are very hard to find.,4,8,2020-12-31 17:39:23
"Not for beginners. Plan isn't taylored at all which I thought was the point of the app. You literally put in beginner, intermediate or advanced and diet, vegan, veggie or normal and magically you have a ""plan"". I'm nowhere near the level of ""beginner"". There's only 3 programs which is ridiculous for the $$. Better workouts on YouTube for free. I have a year sub through AMEX and still cancelling so I don't fall into the (barely legal) trap others have.",1,13,2021-08-21 21:37:13
"Overall... Love the app Just a suggestion/request. Would be nice if some TRX workouts were among the workout library. There might be some, but I can't seem to find them and 'TRX' isn't available as a filter when finding/swapping workouts.",5,0,2020-12-28 23:58:40
"App is Amazing! Only thing is that it's hard to follow up if you are a student or having a full time job. Overall concept is great and you can learn alot from it, definitely will follow up morning workouts and afternoon gym session after my trial runs out. I'll see if I will purchase it in the near future.",5,13,2019-12-16 17:41:32
I thought Chris Hemsworth is cool and he has a workout app so it must be cool and sure enough...it's cool!! The trainers are fun and serious at the same time. The app plans the day out for you which is convenient or you can choose whatever you want. I even went away and tried other apps but didn't like them so I came back. I love the setup too much and it's aesthetically pleasing to me. Just do it!! Now doesn't wait for tomorrow,4,1,2021-09-09 00:44:54
"Really enjoy the app, love the recipes and the workouts. However, would be great to be able to record my weights for each exercise as I do the workout. Also, the timer pauses if you lock your phone, so can drain the battery really fast of you need the timer.",4,23,2020-12-22 21:49:01
"This app and it's total wellness content has been a great one stop shop for keeping me on track and engaged. I love the structure and organization of the app, the content and it's execution. It's very customizable to one's preferences and needs. Got it for a promotion price and I'm getting over and above my money's worth.",5,1,2020-05-19 10:51:52
"I absolutely love this app. It keeps me focused and dedicated. I know can actually meditate. I have always had a tough time and with the help of your app I have learned how to. I also enjoy the wide variety of workouts both guided and non guided. I have yet to try the meals but will slowly be choosing something each week to try (I am super picky). Thanks for creating a wonderful app, a great team and a fantastic Facebook community of people to turn too.",5,0,2020-02-15 15:51:43
"This ap is amazing, so easy to use and workouts are set up so you can follow along easily. You get so much to choose from. I've only used it for 4 weeks and have my strength has improved so much and seeing results with my body tone and muscle gain. Even using the meditations has helped my with getting a better start to my days!",5,2,2020-10-05 01:02:58
Logging weight and sets SUCKS. Way over priced. Not user friendly Hard to search for what you want because program names tell you nothing. Support was rude to deal with. During workout is nice interface though but that's about it. You can find better app for cheaper and more intuitive to use. Lots of good info inside it though.,2,53,2021-07-09 14:25:38
"Awesome app! Have been using it since the very beginning and got absolutely addicted to its variety of workouts, recipes, podcasts! This app seem to be a forever work in progress and it's brilliant to see it evolve with its users following the ""Train. Eat. Live"" mantra.",5,1,2020-04-23 11:36:16
"I'm updating my review after the Centr team refunded me after auto charging a full year after the trial. I had to push a little, but thankfully they relented. The app itself is pretty good, though I didn't get too deep into it. The workouts definitely made me sweat. Whether it's worth $100 a year depends on the person, I suppose. Certainly cheaper than a gym if you use it",4,0,2020-05-21 15:11:02
Amazing app - no faults whatsoever. Awesome workouts (especially during lockdown where you need no equipment - the Centr Unleashed Program is the way to go!). Delicious recipes - and so many of them to choose from!! This really is by far the best workout/health/fitness app I have come across. I'm considering even sticking with this instead of going back to my conventional gym - that's how good it is. Well worth the money. You won't regret.,5,2,2020-05-25 22:51:58
"Love this. I want more Luke and Alexi. More banter, more making fun of each other. When you guys make me crack up it makes the workout fly by.",5,0,2023-05-25 15:25:15
"Great program to strengthen and get for.meal plans are good, wish there were more still but very good. Great instructors and a wide variety of programs to tailor to your fitness level (sedentary to very active). I'm admittedly starting with sedentary, Covid era has not been helpful there. I think it's worth it. Give it a real try, stay where you can and keep trying as you can. It's taken me 2 months to get a regular schedule on it because i was in such bad shape, but i am making progress. Try it",5,14,2021-05-26 03:43:06
"Centr is a great app with great content. From the workouts to meditation to recipes there is a lot to consume here. I would like to have given it a 5 star rating but there are a few functionality things that are missing. Being able to favorite recipes, having a native function to cast the audio/video within the app, and having a native smart speaker integration as well. It would be great to just say ""hey Google, play todays workout from Centr"" Thanks for an awesome service!",4,1,2020-04-15 13:17:14
"Provides incredible workouts with a fun group of absolute machines. Massive list of recipes that are pretty easy and tasty. Easy to use app and they are very switched on when it comes to social media response and updates, new content etc. Will definitely be renewing my subscription.",5,2,2020-10-15 06:01:01
It's a great app! I've used it for about a year now. It makes it easy to follow the program each day and has a ton of great health/fitness/wellness resources. My only complaint is that workouts sometime reset when the screen turns off or after switching between apps,5,3,2021-05-02 12:32:20
"This app isn't that great, the monthly subscription price is ridiculous at $30 if you want to only want to opt for one month. You can get a much better experience from an app that you can pay for one time there are plenty on the Play Store such as progression, home workout, and many other body full body workouts that you can do at home do not pay $30 a month I'm a PT this app is developed by either banking on a celebrity to push it or is designed by a developer using a celebrity to endorse it",1,154,2020-01-06 23:55:04
"The best fitness app and program out on the market. 2016 I started my fitness and health journey, having done several programs. Some good, some bad and at times difficult to follow along. Especially meal plans since they were more of guidelines. Centr has it all, exercise routines easy to follow but challenging. Meal plans, with recipes and tasty plus easy to make. Another step beyond other programs, programs to calm the mind. This again is the best fitness program on the market.",5,1,2020-07-10 00:22:22
"Best planner I've used so far. Meals are actually good, and the ones you don't like or don't work for you (allergies/intolerance/by choice) can be swapped out easily. Lots of options! Workouts are fantastic as well. And I love the meditations.",5,2,2020-10-10 23:35:44
"I really like the app, it's not perfect. But fits my lifestyle well :) upgraded to 1y plan . There are few flaws that I would fix to make it bit more CX and UX centric, would also increase the conversions probably. 7 days free trial is bit short with helping the user to engage more with the app to experience the value of it.",5,4,2020-01-18 05:28:24
"Just got done with my first session of the Centr 6 program. I love how the easy the exercises were to learn and that they had three trainers doing different difficulty levels so everyone can do these workouts! The app is well organized and I found that you don't need equipment to do MANY of the exercises, and they give you tips on things you can improvise with (I used laundry detergent bottles instead of dumbells!) Can't wait to try the meditations and recipes!",5,3,2020-03-30 00:36:01
"The best fitness app around, the training always feels personal and if lacking motivation it pushes you to stick to times and a regimen that suits. As well as all the recipes, classes and mediation it's everything you could need. Has been my salvation during the lockdown.",5,1,2020-04-13 09:16:45
"Amazing app, well thought through, clear exercise programs with easy to follow guides for the odd exercise you've never previously heard of. Haven't tried the meal planning part of the app yet, but I'm sure that will have the same level of polish at the rest of the app. Train like this, need I say anything else 💪!",5,1,2020-09-21 15:43:47
"I really want to like this app, but the full screen video doesn't work properly. You can only see two-thirds of the screen as the timer and page header take up a bit of space, hampering the usability. This is on a Google Pixel 3a.",3,4,2019-12-18 19:36:38
"The Centr program is excellent for exercise, nutrition, and meditation/mindfulness, and the app makes easier to access all the great features. I like the look and organization of the app. I love that the workouts flow seamlessly through warmup to cooldown.",5,4,2019-12-18 01:28:08
"I have exercised on & off for 20 years. The amount of information out there now is mind boggling and often contradictory. This app simplifies everything and takes away the guess work from diet, exercise & recovery. It truly is a must for anyone who wants to improve their health and fitness whatever their goals. The trainers are fantastic & the community is a great place to find support and keep motivated.",5,4,2020-02-14 18:48:22
"I'm really enjoying this app and the overall experience from being a member. The food is delicious, the workout are exactly what I'm looking for as a novice that wants to acieve some real results and the mental health aspects are useful and not at all intrusive. Very happy with Centr!",5,1,2020-04-12 00:18:17
"If you've ever thought that you could get in shape if you had a personal trainer to tell you how to exercise and a nutritionist to pick your food, but you can't afford it: Centr Fit is your answer. The workouts are varied enough to keep them interesting and the menu options are awesome. Also, once you've picked your meals, hit the ""Add to List"" button and your shopping list for the week is done. I love that each day includes a meditation as well because they know it's not just about your body.",5,8,2021-02-24 03:35:30
"I love it. The workouts are amazing, engaging and challenging. The app itself is very well put together incorporating diet, workouts, meditation and even a grocery list. I highly recommend trying the app. I am in week three and already seeing progress.",5,1,2020-04-25 17:35:53
"I'm in the best shape of my adult life and alot of that is thanks to this app. The workouts are as challenging or easy as you'd like them to be and really get to the point not alot of wasted time. The meals look and taste awesome and they make it really easy to get the stuff in the grocery store. The meditations, the instructors, the meal plan, the programs and the workouts are all awesome and the variety is never ending. I really appreciate having this app.",5,3,2020-08-10 04:54:07
"Best fitness and wellness app !!! The workout programs are awesome, the recipes are delicious and its a program I use daily or a couple of times a week and keep coming back to. It's been over a year now and I still love it ! What I love most is the variety, I never get bored !!",5,2,2020-10-20 22:43:23
Loving the app. I chrome cast the workouts to the tv so it's easy to view and follow. After a few weeks am already feeling fitter and healthier and already loosing weight. Only negative I've experienced so far is when you unlock the phone the workout restarts so you need to find where you were at.,5,2,2021-03-02 20:43:04
"Variety of programs, almost unlimited nimber of recipes (although the portions are quite large so be aware of that), emphasis on the correct form of exercises.. you can't go wrong with this purchase if you're serious about the exercise.. And I don't write reviews, so..",5,4,2021-06-26 14:31:53
"Best workout app ever! It has great, deliouces, and healthy meals and snacks. Great workouts for any level fitness and not too long. Wonderful, amazing, and helpful meditations for just about everything and given for kids! This app has been the best and most useful app ive ever downloaded, plus it all truely works and is great for your body and mind. Thank you Centr!",5,1,2020-05-17 21:37:50
"It's hard work but the schedual is helping me feel motivated again and I love it. I swear tons during the work out and I feel like Im doing more then I ever have at a gym. The meditation is great as well, has taught me tons about breathing and relaxing and techniques about getting to sleep better. Overall this app is unbelievable for the price you pay, would recommend to anyone looking to try something new",5,17,2021-03-19 18:59:15
Had it for 9 days. Love the programs and all the small workout options i have. Dan's recipes are excellent and coaches are very clear when describing exercises (i learned english and i understand everything). Workouts are very dynamic and easy to follow. It's a keeper!!!,5,0,2022-05-24 22:33:17
"It's a very good app and the variety means there is something for everyday. I particularly liked the meal ideas. It's excellent for HIIT and functional training. My only issue is the cost. I feel in this market it either has to be low cost or you may as well consider invested in a gym membership, particularly as there are alot of competitors out there.",4,1,2020-05-09 11:47:38
"Best healthy lifestyle app I've ever downloaded and purchased! Only wished that I did it sooner - workouts are challenging and home based friendly. Meals and recipes are easy to follow, minimal fuss, nutritional and delicious - there's always new ones to look forward to each week. My little one loves the sleep visualisation meditations and I find myself using these hidden gems to clear my mind and relax after a long day. Thank you Centr Team!",5,7,2020-12-28 03:16:47
It's awesome. Definitely get it. The technical stuff is a little annoying sometimes. It automatically pauses the workout if you leave the app and it doesn't number the sets. Besides that it's great.,5,1,2020-12-04 22:30:41
"Fantastic, at home gym or away. I use centr at the gym or when travelling and now at home as well! Varied programs, meal plans and more for a complete health picture. Great comms with the Dev team on feature releases and future updates. Updates to plans, meals, meditation frequently so the app is never stale. My only ask is for some spin classes or running to supplement the already great programs. Update - Jan2021. I have been using Centr now for almost a year, and still loving it!!!",5,5,2021-01-19 10:14:05
The workouts are making me sore but I can feel some progress (10 days in). The meals have been tasty and have pushed me into new styles and given me something to riff on on my own. A little strange that each instructor has their own way of managing the intervals but once you realize each one has their own style it isn't too distracting.,5,0,2020-06-14 20:32:23
"Love it. I know it's not for everyone but I love the wholefullness of it. I mainly use the meditation/calm sections and the Pilates/yoga workouts. I'll do the occasional rulk or zoc workout and recipe which works for me perfectly. No app glitches on my end with a pixel or nokia. There's a lot of hype because it's Chris Hemsworth but I took it for what it was which for me was a wholesome approach, it's perfect.",5,11,2021-02-18 22:47:24
"I love this app. The time and thought they put into creating it really shows. I love that it's not just about fitness. The recipes they include are easy, great for people with time limits, AND delicious which is hard to come by. My 1 year old loves the food. I always make an extra portion for him.",5,0,2020-05-25 14:59:01
Great workouts The only draw back is that some programs had the same warm-up and cool down routines which make it boring after 2 weeks. The rest is perfect. Recipes are fantastic and the cool variety of healthy snacks helps to keep your goals.,4,0,2022-02-11 02:57:39
"Pretty good app. A bit too expensive at its full price. Love the holistic approach to fitness and healthy life style. Just an annoying thing, the self guided work outs tend to reset themselves if you swap to another app during the workout. Overall, very good stuff",4,0,2022-01-27 10:34:16
"Thank you, Centr! I've been struggling with my mental health and Centr has stabilised me and kept severe depression/anxiety away. The meals are easy to make, tasty and healthy - amazing for the days when I don't want to eat. The workouts are challenging with options to take it at your own pace - I feel so much better after and they can be done in 30mins. Using the meditations and sleep section, I've had my first full nights sleep in months! I'm comforted and reassured by the friendly Community.",5,1,2020-02-14 09:19:42
"I love the experience so much. The team are great trainers with great techniques. I love the meditation feature, helping me to keep calm and in control in these odd times. Love the recipes and just all round so inspirational and motivational. Everything you could ask for.",5,0,2020-05-29 18:37:11
"The information is there but it's like someone took a workout guide and threw all the pages on the floor. You make your account and then there's no instruction, no guide to how to use the app, no intro video, no explanation to how the program is organized. It's less of a training app and more of a mobile, Hemsworth-backed wiki. It's no more useful than a mindful Google search. Definitely nothing I would pay for.",2,10,2020-04-03 00:12:58
"This app is very effective, it really helps to keep me motivated. Only issue is I can't view the videos without internet. Would be way cooler if I can load the videos whilst online and then play them even when offline. But overall, an awesome app!",5,0,2020-05-31 01:35:36
It's my third time using an app like this and I have to say it's just a boring way to work out. So much repetition and the meals are like expensive snacks that are tough to find in my climate for an affordable price if at all. Wishing I didn't purchase this cause similar things are free on YouTube. I'm one week into a 6 week program and the fact that it's the same work out schedule for 6 days on repeat for 6 weeks - it's Second week in I'm lacking motivation hard.,2,12,2021-12-09 12:53:55
"Best fitness programme I have ever signed up to. The app is brilliant with all the workouts, recipes and meditations to explore, and a weekly planner. Started in January and 3 months in I am already seeing a noticeable difference in the way my clothes fit. Downloading this app and joining Centr is the best decision I have ever made!",5,1,2021-04-04 23:30:34
"Great App for Getting Into Shape! This App offers a complete Mind, Body and Spirit overhaul. It has great facts to help obtain an overall transformation. The Workouts are diverse, challenging & effective. The meal planner is delicious. The Meditations help to calm my soul. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it to anyone getting back into a workout routine 😁",5,4,2020-01-08 04:42:03
I definitely feel more fit and I came into this as someone who regularly exercises. I appreciate the variety of exercises and how I'm being pushed more. My lifestyle and eating habits were in pretty close alignment when I purchased the app and so it hasn't been a stretch for me re: the meals and exercises. I have had 3 knee surgeries so the abundance of HIIT classes has forced me to modify but I've found that to be relative easy. Like the change up as we approach a year of pandemic lockdown.,4,20,2021-03-04 11:07:40
Phenomenal! I've been a founding member and started this app because of the early discount hoping that it would help with a body transformation but didn't have much faith. Managed to lose 30kgs in 6 months and have completely transformed my lifestyle. Can't do without checking this app throughout the day. Love it! Thank you Centr team and keep up with the amazing work! 💪,5,0,2021-02-18 06:21:10
I'm 4 months into Centr and loving it !! All the coaches have great energy and a positive presence. Hope to see continuous updates as time goes on and maybe add Chris as a personal coach for one of the workouts at some point ! Edit: They added a workout with Chris in it and it was very intense and fun! Keep the challenging workouts coming ! 💪,5,0,2021-11-24 22:30:42
"Best App I've downloaded. Been in to fitness and tried many different ways to keep fit. A rock climbing injury saw me put for 4 months. But I've been on this app since I was cleared by physio and I'm getting stronger, fitter and healthier. The community is motivating and food delicious. Meditations are relaxing. If you want to improve your fitness, health and general wellbeing I'd recommend this App.",5,0,2020-05-21 17:29:40
"Great app both for exercise and meal planning. The total package. I love there are multiple trainers teaching different workouts - from weight lifting to plyo to yoga. And, watch out for Da Rulk's functional training. That is one hell of a hard workout. For the meal planning, my wife and I have tried multiple meal planning services over the past 10 years. This app is as good as any of them. Lots of variety of meals to choose from, can easily change the number of servings and shopping list.",5,18,2021-03-31 14:25:34
Really good app for those that need to be pointed in the right direction for exercise and nutrition. Everything is planned out and although I don't always stick with the meals I am more thoughtful about what I eat. The workouts are killer and I'm only doing intermediate. Great app!,5,1,2022-05-23 06:58:37
"I haven't been able to consistently stick with an exercise program until this one. I started out with the 6 week beginners course and its simple to just grab my tablet and yoga pad and hit play. 32 minutes later I'm done. I don't dread the workouts as the coaches are light hearted and the workouts are challenging but not impossible because its all bodyweight. Unfortunately Chris Hemsworth is absent from all workouts, but his trainers do a fantastic job. Its worth the subscription after the trial",5,3,2021-03-19 00:58:13
"The workouts are good, but for an app that seems to be for at home workouts there are a lot of workouts that include things that aren't in the average home: weight bars, benches, full cable machines. It would be nice to have better alternatives to those workouts.",4,1,2020-07-18 16:38:38
"Incredible variety of work outs by top trainers, including different weeks long programs or daily suggestions for training, nutrition, meditation. I am enjoying Centr more and more. Keeps my motivation, my interest, improving my fitness levels, and it is fun! The app itself is a great user experience.",5,0,2021-02-09 13:20:27
Everytime I have tried to log in the past week it logs me out and will not let me log back in.,3,3,2023-08-14 12:55:20
"Great app. Good workouts. Only 4 stars because it is infuriating that you can't download programmes in advance. Not all of us live and work in high and low-cost Internet areas! And great that we have a shopping list, but would be so nice if you could share to whatsapp so you can share when it's your partners turn to shop!",4,1,2022-05-05 01:57:57
"Very decent app, however there were a few issues i found Firstly. The meals in the food section with the shopping list is way too much work There are ingredients you can rarely find with the recipes and you will spend hours at the shop looking for everything Secondly. In the workouts section during the workouts a few of the excercise alternatives are the same as the previous excercise so you end up over working that one excercise Other than that, a decent app but needs some work",3,6,2020-02-08 05:05:16
"The app doesn't take into account neither your experience, nor your abilities, height, weight. I haven't trained in years, indicated or in the app. The very first workout it suggest, with Hemsworth, that killed me after 3rd exercise I nearly fainted. Sure, he is Thor and he can do that stuff so as many other more athletic guys. But you don't ask 20 bucks per month for completely unpersonalised experience. You can find exercises for free for that matter. App looks nice though 🤷‍♂️",2,3,2020-04-02 08:26:27
"This app has completely changed how I think about health and wellness, and I love it! The workouts are challenging yet exciting; and the recipes are delicious and easy to follow. I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great way to switch up their routine or just swap to a healthier, more balanced lifestyle.",5,4,2021-04-22 08:42:46
"I've really enjoyed Centr's tailored fitness schedule. The trainers are great, the workouts are dynamic, interesting and ever changing. The meal plans are great inspiration for me! I just find the app a bit hard to navigate.",4,1,2020-04-06 07:21:48
"Amazing app. Breaks down everything to do with diet, exercise and more which makes working out less of a chore and more of a fun challenge. I'm in the best shape of my life and aim to get better with the use of this app. Also busts the mentality that you have to lift heavy, lift to failure and always push out one last rep to achieve your goals. Work smart, not hard. Can't recommend this app enough.",5,12,2020-07-17 12:50:52
"This app has meditation, different workouts (cardio, boxing, yoga, etc and different professionals to fit your needs), sleep visualizations, and healthy meal plans. This app is great as long you put the work in. Even if you're just in for the meditation for instance, you still get your money worth. I highly recommend it.",5,0,2020-06-28 04:45:48
Really enjoying the workouts and the structure. Only slight critique is that I personally love variation. Once you've done a week the next week is the same pretty much. It would be so good to have a switch up. But I know that's being picky. Otherwise it's 👌,4,0,2021-01-12 10:24:22
"It is a good app, but the cost doesn't make much sense. Most of the work outs require gym membership / major gym equipment which is impossible in this environment. Then add in the food / meal plan which makes matters worse. 15 minute cook time that requires shopping for ingredients and magically getting it all together while juggling work & kids. Honestly the app actually causes stress more than it does taking it away. I'll give it a month, but it doesnt look promising.",3,20,2020-12-09 06:40:57
It's a great experience just needs more content some of the workouts are repetitive but I'm a customer. 2nd review i love the app just a few I think I'm gonna like the new program thats coming out as the older I've got the more I need yoga . Listen if I have 1 complaint the music on the other programs suck ! And just one other thing I know you can set your planner up but on self guided days I need to switch that maybe to yoga and I can't and I'm so OCD your great though Love the app!,5,0,2021-01-12 23:32:54
"Amazing fitness app. Excellent meal plans, workouts and well-being section. This app has really helped me improve my diet and I am training harder then ever! The various difficulty levels will be handy for more experienced exercisers and those just starting out. Highly recommend.",5,3,2022-02-08 01:51:45
"Great fitness support, like having a personal trainer! I've done lots of different exercise styles in my life, but I'm particularly enjoying this app! Something about following along and checking off exercises on the phone I find encouraging and I'm motivated to train all the time. I highly recommend this app!",5,1,2020-05-16 21:56:57
"I love it!!! It's giving me so much more strength, flexibility, and agility than i could have ever imagined!! I have so much energy to go about each day with a positive attitude!! My endorphins are at another level because I feel so proud of every challenging circuit I complete!! My body is changing in ways I never thought imaginable and I am beyond happy with this app!! The trainers are so enthusiastic and funny (donuts)! It's well worth the money and the recipes are easy and delicious.",5,0,2022-05-10 02:00:11
"Too advanced. I felt like I already needed to be in good shape. Im over 55 and disabled and there was no way I could handle the exercies. I did like some of the meals but found them out of my budget. And the meditation was a grest idea. Another drawback was the price. It would have been fine if I could pay monthly, but a whole year at a time was out of my limited budget. I do wish you best of luck Chris and your splendid team!",3,2,2021-01-22 17:49:25
Great app with easy to follow programs that include video descriptions of each exercise. Would be a 5 star app if the timer worked in the background and if the app worked without an internet signal. For the subscription price I would expect these features by default.,3,0,2022-06-09 23:03:40
"Great app, just following the recipes and the workouts I have already lost 5kg in 4 weeks and I have been able to gain muscles, also I'm feeling more energetic during the day. Little feedback advice: If you can introduce a ""list of favourite workout"" it would be fantastic. I always need to go through the workouts to find the one I wanted. Thanks a lot",4,2,2020-05-21 05:30:22
"One of the most well-rounded fitness apps out there! The workouts are varied, and you can increase/decrease the level of difficulty based on your goals. The food is nutritious, and the cooking instructions are clearly stated. The meditations bring a much appreciated moment of peace, and the community you gain access to is encouraging and supportive. The only reason this is not a 5 star review is due to the absence of a chromecast feature (which I'm sure will come). Otherwise, it's perfect!",4,5,2020-02-14 09:48:34
"Very good app, great workouts, some great recipes, and great meditations. It is rather pricy but definitely worth it. Works best if you have a schedule to give yourself enough time to prepare meals and complete the workouts. Overall a great app and great lifestyle.",4,0,2020-05-16 20:51:25
"Been using this app for about 2 and a half weeks and I love it. It is such a well rounded fitness app and totally worth it. The recipes are great and so easy, love that it has a shopping list I can use. I haven't lost weight but I lost 1 inch in my waist and 1 inch in my thighs after just the first week. Loving this app.",5,7,2021-08-18 23:27:48
"I've been using this app for 3 months now and have lost a total of 26 pounds so far. I'm not quite to my goal yet (another 22 lbs) but I have put on a lot of muscle and look and feel much healthier than I have ever felt before. I've never been confident in how I've looked before, but this app has turned that right around. The workouts are definitely not easy, but you can feel yourself being able to do just a little bit more each week.",5,2,2020-04-08 02:05:26
Worth every penny! I work full time in healthcare and take care of an active toddler with another kid on the way any day now. Needless to say carving out the time for a full fitness routine is a struggle. Thankfully Centr takes care of all the planning and tells you EXACTLY what to do and how to do it with an incredibly easy to use interface. They even get your kids involved with some of the activities. I've been at it 30 days now and def notice an improvement in muscle gain and overall health.,5,15,2020-10-27 23:41:44
"I can't really rate this app as I didn't get to actually do any of the workouts. Not many options for the payment plans, either pay £23/monthly and end up paying £276/year or choose the £94 12months plan which has to be paid all at once. Ill agree it still works out cheaper monthly than most gym memberships but still gutted the payment plans are so rigid. I'd heard so many good things about centr workouts and I was really looking forward to working out with this app.",1,15,2022-01-03 14:01:23
Could use the function to download workouts and programs. My undergound gym has no mobile phone signal whatsoever so the self guided option doesn't help. Hope this will be implemented in the future. Otherwise very happy to continue my subscription for this excellent fitness app which includes meal plans. Has a big library of workouts from weightlifting to boxing to yoga so there's a lot of variety on offer. Excited for the new workout program starting soon.,4,0,2021-01-14 08:12:41
This is a Great app for a workout at home or the gym. I love all the different options you have for workouts and i can keep my workouts interesting and not get burned out. The meditation is a huge bonus! My girls love the ones for kids and i do a meditation daily ♡ And all the food is delicious! This app is amazing and very well thought out.,5,22,2021-09-28 16:26:40
Incredible fitness tool. The daily plan is nice and varied and offers up some great recepies and workouts. I do wish they included some suspension training / trx workouts as these are great for at home or on the road. Also wish that when following a programme that it would add that into your daily planner. Well worth the subscription though.,5,0,2021-02-20 08:08:13
"This is the best app i have tried so far and ive tried alot. The app auto loads your workouts and meals every day based on goal and experience. Dont like a meal theres a button to swap it out. You just check off everything in your planner and your done for the day. The meals rely on real food not supplements. It will also create a shopping list based on your week of meals. Big family np, just increase the servings and the recipe and shopping list increase.",5,26,2021-06-09 20:50:46
"This app is perfect! It has helped me eat healthier while still always feeling full and my old cravings have vanished. The shopping list they put together is the cheapest list I've ever had. I am stronger, happier, healthier. This is by far and away more than I ever expected and I have never been happier to be a part of this team of legends!",5,1,2020-04-06 16:32:05
"Amazing food, brilliant workouts (for all abilities),Great articles/podcasts/meditations. Easy to use with great save/swap feature. A brilliant online support community and an App team who really engages with and listens to users. I love love love this, wouldn't be without it x",5,0,2020-07-14 10:05:57
"It may just be the center 6 program but it looks like the trainers only do 2 rounds, the set up round and the second round and then that is repeated for the other 4. It would be nice to see them do the full workout. 👍",4,0,2021-02-18 17:53:47
Thumbs up for finally developing the Android version. The app is fluid and easy to navigate. It could be better if the app had an offline mode where you could download videos to your device. Isn't the idea of this app to work out anywhere possible?,4,4,2019-12-17 13:53:08
"Great app. I, personally never realised how effective it was to have a personal trainer/coached workout. Made a big difference to my motivation and I'm now feeling fitter. So many coaches and options to choose, meaning this app suits all! Personal favourites were Michael the boxer(tuesday) and Luke's hitt strength (Monday)! Also really enjoyed the video with Luke and Chris Hemsworth doing a bonus workout! Recommend highly!only issue is how complex some meal's are therefore hard to obtain.",4,1,2020-07-02 11:44:15
"Great lifestyle app. I open it 3 - 5 times a day and have certainly noticed a difference in my level of fitness (I generally keep a pretty healthy diet and also worked out regularly prior to signing up for centr). I have a few wishlist items for the app, but its core purpose is certainly achieved.",5,0,2020-07-17 23:54:59
"I'm very impressed by the content this app has to offer. It has various training programs that target every part of the body. Programs are included that require weight and there's also several workout programs that are all bodyweight exercises. This app is ideal whether you prefer to work out at home with limited equipment or at the gym where equipment is provided. Several meal plans are included as well, and there's even a section for meditation. Clearly the developer cares about the customer.",5,0,2020-04-07 01:02:11
"Really love this app, super user friendly, has a HUGE variety of workouts from trainers, to type of class, duration of class, and level of difficulty. The meals are delicious and as a mom I appreciate how they are so family friendly. I honestly recommend this app to as many people as I can.",5,3,2021-04-13 05:08:31
"Pretty comprehensive app with meal plan, workout routines for both physical and mental wellness. Great for anyone beginner, experienced or advanced when it comes to personal fitness. Seeing results already in two weeks on the muscle growth program. Listen to the trainers, they are great at coaching form to prevent injury and maximize the routine! Would definitely recommend if your goals are to lose weight or gain muscle!",5,5,2021-06-20 18:27:44
"I'm loving this app... the work outs really get you going, I added cardio to get my heart rate in and then jump into the workout. If you don't have the equipment use alternatives... ( gallons, towels, jugs) for me I used my bowling ball 10lbs, 12lbs and a 14lbs for advancement... not there yet I'm in between beginner and intermediate. Keeping this app after the trial!",5,11,2020-03-27 18:44:43
"Only one advanced programme. The voice overs for each exercise are very repetitive and outputting after the 3rd or more times. The concept is good, instruction clear and it's definitely a sweaty workout but not enough in the red zone for me",3,3,2021-03-16 19:17:37
"Centr is a great workout program and space. It focuses on a holistic approach with not only solid work outs, but also mediations, recipes, smoothies and snack suggestions. Child meditations have just been added which is ideal for any parents seeing a chaotic amount of there loved ones. The program is what I looked forward to in my 2 weeks of isolation and it kept me motivated. Having 3 main instructors (a couple more pop up none but are Chris Hemsworth) makes if feel slightly more social.",5,1,2020-04-16 05:26:22
I like the variety of routines and trainers available to me. I really enjoy the different 6 week programs they have launched. The meditation and wellness posts are helpful. The menus are always interesting and healthy but not boring.,4,0,2021-03-21 13:30:44
"The app design and interface are well-done! Simply easy to navigate around. The daily planner for exercise and meals is fantastic, it provides a discipline for to get me exercise everyday from the comfort of my home. For mummies, this app is the one!",5,1,2021-12-15 10:43:08
"So easy to use! I love the combination of workouts, food planner and meditation... Truly a whole health approach to fitness. Workouts are so varied, easy to swap, and I am able to fit in 30 min (or less) every day. I am currently loving the Centr 6 workouts!! The recipes are easy to change and are delicious. Loving the meditations...the mental component is often overlooked in most fitness programs. Overall, simple, well rounded and inspiring! What more could you want!",5,4,2020-02-17 00:19:22
"Love the App particular how you can mark off all your progress day by day while also adding all your food to the shopping list. Love the meditation and sleep parts also. Only issue I have found is the weight lifting. It seems like very little as it only had me doing two excercise across 5 sets. Would be worried that this isn't enough. The nutritional side as well although the meals are good, it took no input of my current weight and goal weight to calculate calories. Keen for feedback",4,0,2020-01-20 19:00:55
"Great all around fitness app. You get more than what you're paying for and dven if you only use one of the features is so worth it. This helped me get back to exercise because they're fast, easy workouts for all types of goals. Couldn't recommend it more",5,0,2022-08-05 04:37:27
I thought that this app was a great way for me to try and bulk up my body. Definitely made me feel like I was striving for a new me. I only wish that this app would track your weight and do some before and after photos. Or it could definitely make some monthly or weekly progress notifications. Other than that. This app is definitely great. 👍,4,16,2020-10-30 03:22:51
An option for multiple sessions in a day would be nice. I'm doing yoga in the morning and a workout at lunch but I can only record 1 session. Also a weekly view of the food menu would be nice for when planning the week. Loving the app!!,5,1,2020-04-27 23:09:49
"You've got to stick with it (no pain no gain!) but I don't regret getting this app. It's kept me motivated and I've tried workout styles I've never even thought about before and found real improvement! If you're serious about using the app and getting the most from it, I would recommend it. Hope you all reach your goals! Have fun!",5,1,2020-08-03 12:55:36
"Good so far, enjoy the meal plans and workouts. Have had a recurring issue where the meals portion sizes are poorly planned and end up with far less food than it would take to feed me and my partner for 4 serves as we have set the ingredients to. Also the shopping list has ommited certain items from recipes and instead told us to get things we don't need (i.e no mention of coconut cream for the Dahl we were having that night, yet it told us to buy 8 eggs which were not needed.)",4,1,2020-05-12 21:33:41
99.9% love this app and every thing it offers. My .1% is only that I can't go out of the app to access other apps during my rest periods. When I do that in the middle of a guided workout it loses my progress in that workout and restarts the workout when I open the app again.,5,1,2022-09-27 07:52:52
I love this app. The workouts have made bigger and faster improvements in my body than any other program I've done (and I've done several). I also love the huge variety of recipes that satisfy many styles of eating. AND the meditations put me right to sleep!!,5,1,2020-07-20 15:21:55
"App is easy to use. Never had a problem with it. Love the exercise programs and amount of daily info. Only frustration is sometimes there isn't a modification of a harder exercise, other then that very happy!",5,0,2020-08-23 23:34:55
"Constant new workouts and a great variety of levels. It has decent alternate exercises and a great meal plan. My only wish is to be able to add more than one workout to the daily planner. It lets you swap workouts, but sometimes I wanna add a workout to a certain day.",5,0,2022-04-28 20:46:08
"So easy to get started with the coached workouts, planner and programmes, then build in the nutrition over time. Fits in easily to my gym visits and it's great to see the steady results I've been getting over time. I like that there is a wide variety of disciplines so I can switch to be things as I progress.",5,0,2022-08-29 10:44:27
"I'm giving this app a 3 star rating because it does not have the ability to switch out or add in workout movements, you can't log anything no charts or graph to see previous week of lifting. There are good things about this tho, recipes are nice meditations, sleeping visualization are nice but the workout are just not there exactly if I renew my subscription I would like see some more thing added to the Centr app.",3,0,2022-07-31 19:45:35
"Loving the workouts! Would be great to have a ""save for offline"" option to use when no internet connection is available. I work out at sea a lot so can only use the app when close enough to land to get cell/mobile service.",4,2,2021-10-11 14:06:32
The workouts are so varied and there are so many. I never get bored. The meal plans are AMAZING. Just that justifies the price of the subscription to me. I can focus on Yoga for weeks and then switch to Pilates or weight training. I can follow along with one of the programs or just follow the default plan. It's the best app I've ever used to make healthy eating and getting exercise part of my lifestyle. It would be nice to be able to search for meals with a specific ingredient as a query,5,0,2020-05-28 00:49:41
"confusing at the start if you've no experience. Takes a while to catch on. Lots of options for fitness, recipes, meditation and mental wellness. Absolute best thing is the access to a private Facebook community. Amazing! Motivation, encouragement, support in a non-judgmental atmosphere. Try on a free trial if offered.",4,0,2022-02-23 18:29:22
"Awesome App!!! I seriously love this, it makes working out from home a lot more fun and easy. Also the recipes are amazing. If you want to still eat your guilty pleasure foods then they have those recipes but with healthy versions!! I have been using this app for a week now and and already feel better and have more energy. I am also sleeping better with night time meditation. Get this app, seriously you will never regret it",5,17,2020-04-01 18:56:12

Great workout and lifestyle platform. Plenty of workout choices so your workout never feels repetitive. Love how they adapted to gym closures by introducing low/no equipment workouts in the planer. Meditations and very helpful and meals look very tasty. Only wish they let you filter meals by excluding foods you don't or can't eat.,5,1,2020-04-28 00:31:48

Great app it has help me be active during the lockdown a bit pricey imo but I paid it anyways. A criticism that I have is that my workout plan has a lot of workouts evolving shoulders and traps almost daily evolving those muscles. Don't get me wrong they look amazing but I would like more variety like more biceps and others. Fortunately you can swap workouts if it feels too repetitive.,4,0,2020-05-21 10:54:09

Been doing the plan for just 2 weeks. Already lost 14lbs. Looking forward to continuing to get in shape and eat better. Great variety in exercises and meals. Foods delicious too. Wish there was suggested snacks on the plan to fill in any needed vitamins or to give you energy/muscle recovery.,5,1,2020-09-29 22:31:06
"This is nice and informative. I think overall it's a good app, but if you looking for a tailored program with more weights involved and structured meal plan and direction this app is not the one. I think this is a really helpful app for beginners who are just starting out.",3,2,2021-02-13 16:54:14
"Amazing, started losing the stubborn fat around my waist in no time. There are an insane amount of workouts that you can swap to, and each one is different and keeps things interesting. I love that most of the workouts require little equipment, so you can do them at home. Well worth the money!",5,2,2020-02-16 16:24:02

I love that the workouts are coached and you have the trainers cheering you on the whole time! I started Centr 6 and I'm on my last week. The program is amazing and I cannot wait to start the next one on May 18th. I also love that they have so many recipes on the app and they're all different but amazing. This has to be my favorite workout app and the trainers have a sense of humor during the workouts too which makes it much more fun to complete. I rarely rate any app but this was a must!,5,1,2020-05-09 16:14:17
"Fantastic fitness program, varied, achievable and see results pretty quickly. Love the additional things like meditation and recipes too.

"Great app, flexible, well structured (love da rulk sessions, keeps my lower back pain away) and cheap. Hubby uses it too. Snack recipes are yummy. I recommend paying A LOT of attention to correct posture and to keep core engaged at all times (ex-pilates fan here). Overall pretty good!",5,4,2021-06-28 00:59:56
"Just downloaded the app today and everything is going smoothly, seems amazing! I like how the entire monthly plan is laid out for you so I can prep meals in advanced. Following everything is simple and no hassle. One issue of mine is that I want to loose belly fat but to also gain muscle. I don't know what to choose as my workouts and my goal and its a little annoying as I'm stuck. I will write another review after my 1 month to see how things went.",4,0,2020-05-25 15:21:13
"This app has me excited to be in the gym again! I love the variety in workouts and trainers the the option to step it up or slow it down in each session. The recipes, meditations, and articles are a huge bonus and you can't beat the centr team and community!",5,0,2020-02-15 16:53:30
There is a great variety of programs for all fitness levels. I have young children so I like the programs that take less time so I can achieve a full workout whenever I get the chance. I also really love all the snacks and meals within the app. I've made a few so far and they're a hit with the whole family. Well done to all involved.,5,14,2020-10-10 06:03:20
Enjoying it heaps so far! Some constructive feedback that I'm sure more users will appreciate: it would be great to have the option to lower the volume; I personally enjoy listening to podcasts or music while I exercise.,5,1,2020-04-02 09:35:52
The App that keeps giving and is so much more than just a workout app. It's straight forward to use and follow. The programmes are varied and all first class. The meal selection keeps growing with loads of tasty options that are customisable. Great blogs and articles to read.,5,0,2022-07-03 17:39:10
"I've used this app sporadically since its release and it's been very helpful. Most of the workouts have a duration of 30 min, perfect for a busy lifestyle. Meals are great, as are the meditation readings. Love the raport and banter between the trainers. Downside: when used daily, it can get a tad repetitive (inc banter) although they often release new content. I'd recommend Centr to have at least one trainer release a new workout every week (Luke!) Or mix up existing recordings like F45.",4,0,2020-07-21 20:43:29
Warning - charged me for an extra year when wanted to cancel. When you cancel you do not get any confirmation. I noticed that they charged me for another year and contacted them the next day. I was told that they will do nothing because they did not have that I cancelled before an have a strict policy. Now I am stuck paying for another year when I thought I had cancelled and had uninstalled the app months before it renewed.,1,0,2022-11-25 10:38:25
"Unable even to create a trial account and get past setup screens - just a cutesy ""sorry we dropped a dumbbell"" error message. Support, if you're reading this, don't bother with a reply. This does not bode well for a paid app; I've already uninstalled.",1,6,2021-01-02 20:27:08
It is a good start. A lot of room for improvement. I should be able to add notes to recipes that can be saved. Being able to relate recipes would be welcomed as well. Self-guides workouts should allow for substitutions and be able to track them.,3,2,2022-03-21 22:36:42
"Daily challenges that keep me moving and interested..I'm at the advanced level and still feel like I am and still can improve. Fantastic menu planning, meditations, and well being articles. The community is supportive and helpful.",5,1,2021-03-02 13:45:24
Unbelievable app. I can't fault it at all. It has everything you need in one app. The workouts are varied and challenging and the food has so much flavour. I used to workout alot doing the same week in week out. Never done Pilates or yoga before but love incorporating them into weekly sessions. Keep up the good work.,5,11,2021-01-31 09:47:32
Tasty meals ( some very strange ingredients in some) - download able meals would be useful Good workouts ( could do with some slightly more toned down for complete beginners) Easy to use app (good layout) Only thing that will hold you back is your own motivation... All in all great app,4,1,2021-01-29 15:32:15
"I love everything this app has to offer. So many choices of workouts, with and without equipment. The meditation choices are abundance too. Recipes are simple to follow, quick and easy plus creates a shopping list too. I've lost 3 kilos so far and I am enjoying Centr to the max.",5,1,2020-06-18 06:34:05
I love everything about this easy to use app the programs are designed for all abilities and strengths the very yummy and realist food recipes options designed around Australian seasonal availability... 😋🤤 Great work team I talk this up to everyone and haven't had any bad experiences reported back!,5,1,2020-08-12 18:37:02
This has been a great at home workout for me and my daughter. All of the exercises are doable at home and the programs keep us on track. We have both seen incredible results in terms of strength and energy level as well as weight loss. I highly recommend Centr to anyone of any fitness level.,5,9,2020-12-28 01:39:31
"Best fitness app so far. Well structured training sessions catering to different range of fitness. Coaches are the best always fun to exercise with! That aside, there is a big community who is always encouraging and loveing and backing each other! Can't ask for more right!",5,0,2020-05-16 02:02:37
"Been using this app since autumn 2020, initially using as a way to keep moving through the multiple lockdowns. Cannot compliment the content enough. Great trainers, great programs, good looking meals and most importantly, the most supportive community of fellow #legends from each corner of the globe.",5,0,2021-03-24 14:43:28
"In an inside world, this is really good to keep track of goals and always have that daily workout to look forward to. The vegan cooking options are tops. This app is more than it's advertised. Good vibes.",5,1,2020-05-01 10:09:08
Riddled with bugs. App constantly crashes. Everything resets when turning phone around. Sounds stupid but you paying for an app by a hemsworth but no where to be seen in any training videos i watched or routines so if your after it for that purpose don't bother.,1,11,2019-12-27 08:14:56
I used the 7 day free trial and it was a surreal experience with the app and i made some solid progress I never thought be possible my issue is if it would be possible to have a free version with some obvious limitations for those who cannot afford the monthly or yearly plan such as myself but other than that an amaizing app keep up the good work,5,1,2020-09-24 10:17:55
"Third week in and I'm enjoying the app alot. For someone who was always lost in the gym and wasn't sure where to begin with workouts and meal plans, this app is definitely helpful. My goal is to build muscle and gain weight and I am already seeing results. The only negative I have so far is you don't have the ability to pre-download the guided workouts in order to save data and this app eats alot of data. I had to take screenshots of the workouts and then log my results once I have wifi.",5,18,2021-11-13 11:40:35
I've been struggling with getting myself to get in shape since highschool. I wasn't comfortable being lanky with no tone. I started using Centr in about July of last year. Couldn't have been a better decision. I love the programs and workouts and love the progress I've made mentally and physically. This app is the greatest.,5,1,2022-01-22 02:05:19
"Hard but also informative. I like the different levels and that if I'm not feeling like a hard workout, I can change to a different one and still feel happy I did something. The recipes tastes so good. The challenges are fun. I like all the trainers too",5,1,2021-08-13 13:05:35
"Be careful to check their billing and subscription terms and conditions. I was unknowingly locked into an ongoing annual subscription after paying 12 months up front. I was no longer using the service but got charged without warning. I realised within 24 hours, but they REFUSED to issue a refund",1,2,2022-02-06 19:58:10
"Great app, awesome workouts, fantastic meal plan, great interface, super cool program. I took 1 star because when I put im female I don't get as much weight training like I love, it's super expensive and I can't listen to my music while I workout. But definitely in top 3 Fitness Apps. I love it",4,5,2020-01-04 00:59:47
"It's everything the advertising suggests. If you're like me and been out of the gym for a while or wandered around the gym lost without a routine this is the app for you. It gives you direction, details of what you'll be doing and why as well as a nice meal guide (though I find myself straying from it quite often.) I did the 7 day trial and found it so helpful I decided to commit for the year and I haven't missed a workout yet. Try it, you won't regret it.",5,0,2022-07-13 19:12:49
"Really bad customer service. I went to cancel two days before expiry but their system was not working and every time I went to the subscription section, it took me back to the main page. I emailed their support team, and they got back to me on the day of renewal and charged me $119. When I queried thus they refused to refund me!",1,46,2021-08-06 01:09:28
Nearly two years into using this app consistently. Has changed my life for sure. Never felt this energetic. Have enjoyed the different workout options available and they keep updating the workouts which keeps the workouts fresh. Highly recommended.,5,0,2022-03-19 14:38:36
I recently downloaded this app for Victorias second wave of lock down. It's been awesome to have pre-planned workouts I can do with my housemates. I am currently doing the 6 week intermediate programme. My only criticism is the repetition of the warm up and warm downs. I would expect for the price that they would be mixed up a little. 6 weeks of the same warm up and cook down is kind of a drag.,4,25,2020-08-19 08:10:04
"I had to stop using this app due to health issues. I had paid for an annual subscription but hadn't used it for about 6 months when I noticed a new charge on my credit card for the subsequent year. I contacted Centr immediately to let them know I didn't want to renew for the year yet they said that were unable to refund the subscription, leaving me out of pocket $130 for a service I am unable to use. Legal but immoral and I'm super disappointed to say the least.",1,15,2023-04-02 04:47:47
I enjoy the variety of workouts styles you can get in this app. Also the recipes are enjoyable. The only thing I wish was there was some way to check progress or set some goals like do at least three workouts for a week for the next month or so,4,1,2020-05-14 20:17:05
Great workout+ app. Doing just the standard set up has given me great results in an easy to follow program. Changes every three weeks or so and the scaling is great. I've only scratched the surface and it's been worth the premium cost,5,0,2022-06-24 01:27:13
"Lots of helpful tools: healthy recipes that you can import directly to a grocery list, swappable (and modifiable) exercises & recipes, etc. Several trainers with different workout and coaching styles, different equipment levels, etc. Note: Some of the recipe ingredients are a little bougie, but can be substituted (ex: ""tuna in spring water"" is just 'tuna in water' for those of us who can't afford to shop at whole foods all the time).",5,1,2023-01-16 23:00:23
"I have been using this app for over a month now and I love it. We have tried other apps that are similar to this one but this one wins hands down. Plenty of variety to choose from, depending on what you want to target. And they just keep improving it with new workouts. Now they have included palates and yoga to choose from in addition to all the other options. I really don't like to pay for an app but this one is worth every penny plus it really is not that expensive for everything you get.",5,17,2020-11-10 23:29:37
"I've been using Centr for more than a year. I find the coached training programs are easy to follow and have challenged myself to do the beginner, intermediate and then advanced for each program. Still working through them and still engaged. It was very good during Covid-19 Lockdown.",5,2,2022-09-29 20:42:14
Best fitness app on the planet! Don't pass it by thinking it's a celebrity vanity project - Centr is far and away the best fitness app I've ever used. 1. The workouts are challenging but work and adjust to all fitness levels. 2. Deliciou recipes galore! 3. Meditations! 4. Useful blog posts! 5. An ever expanding selection of programs for any fitness goals! 5. And saving the best for last: An amazing group of coaches who will challenge and motivate you every step of the way!,5,11,2021-06-15 01:20:41
"A week and a half into the beginner program, and 8 years back pain is suddenly more manageable, sometimes non-existent. It hasn't been easy, but following the program and meal plan have already yielded so many positive benefits, more than any exercise I've done in the past. The trainers are very positive and encourage you to push yourself, but never to the extent that some of the extremists out there take it. I wake up sore the next day, but I can feel my body getting stronger.",5,0,2020-06-20 22:50:26
I've been using this app for going on a year and besides some small things I'd like to see such as substitutions in recipes and not being able to challenge friends like on other fitness apps. It has been great for trying new ideas for eating and working out. 10/10 recommend to try it,4,0,2021-02-12 01:03:00
"Generally one of the better fitness apps... But joining a program has no effect on the daily planner. The recommended workout isn't the day's workout from the program, and when you go into the program there's no way of knowing what day you're up to if you've skipped a day and lost track. They're disconnected. Having joined a program I'd expect that to be the main part of my plan.",3,0,2022-08-20 10:54:21
Excellent and well thought out app! Have been using it for about 3 months and I have been losing 5kg ever since I started! The meditation and sleep visualization portion is very helpful to the mental health as well! Highly recommended!,5,0,2020-07-14 13:04:51
I got the app for free trial. I canceled one day late and had 3 months charged. I wrote them at that to ask for reimbursement of all or at least 2 months. I lost my job 2 days later due to the pandemic. I wrote them again and asked for reimbursement of $65 because I needed it now to pay bills etc. Never heard back.,1,3,2020-05-09 05:56:44
Loving this! Ive been using the free Nike work out and run apps for a year or so. Ive really enjoyed them but what i prefer about this one is there is a program of short 30min daily classes that gives me motivation to work out regularly. Its not just a chain of exercises either its like a proper guided class. The sleep visualisations and meditations are also great. My son loves the kids ones to wind down too. I havent tried the food yet.,5,2,2021-03-15 19:53:39
"First time using and it only went as far as trying to set a password, one that obviously met the criteria and the field was set to invalid like if it expected 8 characters long passwords with only 1 uppercase and 1 number with no proper explanation as to why it's invalid. This absolutely ridiculous.",1,10,2021-05-22 11:43:16
Love the app! Currently attempting the centr 6 program just completed day 4! Killer workouts but worth it! Me and my family love the app for the workouts as well as the recipes and meditations and articles. I don't think theres an app similar that has all the features centr has and I've tried many before but never stuck until I found centr! Would recommend to anyone!,5,1,2020-04-10 04:04:22
"Love this app! I am really enjoying the coached workouts and finding them very motivating. Each time I do a workout/yoga flow I feel so accomplished. It's always something new and different which keeps it fresh. I can do so much without equipment just being at home, it's great. I think the meditations are an excellent idea and my kids love joining in. Especially with 4 small kids, not having a gym membership or lots of free time, the workouts are achievable. I'm loving Centr!",5,0,2022-08-03 05:39:30
Easy to use and the 6 week programme has been perfect at motivating me to increase my exercise. Great instructions and low impact options available as required. Only downside is kick sits :-) I still can't get the hang of those things.,5,0,2020-06-11 06:37:36
"Did Google really just remove my previous review? Lol! Ok I'll write another. App doesn't work as it won't even let me sign up. I get to the password phase and enter one that meets the criteria and nothing. Keeps saying it failed to create an account. You'd think that would be a simple fix and no auto response by this developer, I will not email your help team to resolve this. I shouldn't have to email your support team for you to fix your app.",1,3,2021-06-14 13:57:02
"I'm in love with Centr! This app has everything you need to reach your fitness goals. They have beginner, intermediate and advanced levels for losing weight, getting fit and toned, and building muscle. They have an amazing food program, they also talk about the importance of stretching and proper sleep, very well rounded, the online community is incredibly supportive and positive. I've been doing Centr6 (a program within Centr) and I noticed improvements within the 2nd week. Highly recommended.",5,21,2020-02-21 17:49:17
Everything is awesome... I like that the videos give an alternative if you have limited equipment. I wish there were an option to save your favorite workouts and exercises and meals.,4,1,2020-03-28 13:50:01
A few weeks in and I feel that I'm getting stronger and my cardio is increasing. I wish this app was on roku so I could use this on my TV instead of my phone but that's not really a big deal. Just throw on the Bluetooth headphones and put in the work.,5,1,2021-04-08 01:47:44
The missus and I like this app very much the centr 6 experience was easy to get motivation to complete the workouts with the simple layout and sence of progression that we got from ticking the day's workout off and unlocking the next day. We kept up the whole time and we've gotten so much fitter because of it! Chur mr hemsworth your trainers are the best.,5,1,2020-04-09 00:04:51
Honestly brilliant. But need a way to save recipes and workouts!!!! Pleaseeee. Some people may also miss a way to log workouts. But this is by far the best all-in-one fitness app without a doubt.,5,1,2020-04-25 14:41:18
Awesome!! A CLASS apart!! It's the best workout/fitness app I have experienced. The coaches are fantastic!! Diets so doable and delicious too! This one's got a chip on the shoulder! Also I looovvveeee their meditation/sleep visualisations..works for me!!,5,0,2020-07-08 07:00:09
"Nice features but sections get cut off too soon. Feels like the segment isn't done before it just cuts off so has an impersonal feeling sometimes. An irritation is that the segment goes into warm up as soon as you start not giving you time to put your phone down before having to start working. Also it should give you the option to cast before you start. You have to start, then cast, so you've already missed some time. Then you pause it to cast & it unpauses again. Should stay paused till ready",4,1,2022-03-16 21:27:42
"Great workouts, great meal plans, lots of variation, mental health elements are great also . Won't ever be a 5 star service until they provide an offline mode for at least your shopping list and your workouts of the day. Not everyone has access to good signal or WiFi all the time.",4,1,2021-08-27 07:16:46
"This is an amazing app,took a second to get into it but I love how each day is set up with a new work out and a meal plan for the day for the whole week depending on what your goal is. I have been dopey doing the centr6 program and can feel the difference. I will admit I would love to see more of these workout programs each based on a goal like a cardio program to make you faster or one to bulk up. It would be cool to see diet programs too like, transitioning to vegetarian or a body cleanse diet",4,2,2020-07-07 17:14:44
Brilliant app. The self guided and video tutorials are so good and really help with keeping the motivation. Love that you can see the time bar and the sessions are broken down into activity and rest periods. Easy to use.,5,1,2022-03-09 18:51:05
"Best training app I've ever used! Food options are absolutely brilliant, delicious and really easy to prepare. Great Vegan plan with loads of variety. The most sustainable plan I've been on and I've got my mum onto it too! Loads of workouts - they're funny, quick, effective and keep you engaged. You won't be disappointed 😀",5,1,2022-08-22 08:47:39
"The app is amazing, great workouts, helpful planner, and fantastic options for everyone. The one downside is the nutrients part of it is made for quite expensive plates for a lower to moderate income household. Options for different budget price meals would be great.",4,0,2020-06-22 21:34:02
"Absolutely amazing app, it will give you meal ideas where you can choose how many portions do you want and it will create shopping list for you. You can follow one of six weeks programs or you can do coached or self-guided training. It offers mindfulness sessions as well so it will train your body from inside out.",5,1,2020-07-23 16:46:14
"Incredible and life changing, I've seen such amazing results from the varied and fun workouts. The recipes are delicious too and it's full of information and tips and motivation. I'm 6 months post baby number 2 and in great shape and have fitness and strength, all thanks to this amazing app. Worth every cent.",5,29,2020-09-28 22:18:39
"This offers so many options, everything from HIIT exercises to boxing to meditation and yoga to meal prep. I love that you can switch things out and add recipes to a shopping list. It's hard to swallow paying for a year up front but that choice definitely gives the beet value.",5,3,2020-12-08 18:10:56
"Awful. I am furious, there is no communication from the app when payments are going to be taken, it's difficult to unsubscribe from the app, and they refuse to cancel an unwanted subscription and provide a refund, even on exactly the 12 month mark. I now have just been charged $100 I don't have for this awful app for another 12 month period. Absolutely terrible customer service and manipulative app. Terrible parasitic business model. Do not join it, you're being robbed.",1,86,2021-05-18 03:49:30
Very hard but each day is so rewarding and getting though it makes you feel so good for doing something so great for yourself. I am a mum of two and have not done any exercise in the last 6 years but the beginners program has been developed gradually and its only been 2 weeks but my body and my husbands are starting to take shape. Our clothes are fitting so much better. We are looking forward to completing our 6 weeks and moving onto the intermediate program.,5,0,2020-06-16 07:43:41
"Had it for three weeks now, enjoying the workouts the way they mix it up. The meal plans would have to be my favourite and the easy shopping list. Only think it's lacking is an ability to record your weights.",4,2,2020-09-03 09:25:35
"Great platform in general. Super fun and engaging community. I personally don't really use half of the content (sticking to some specific workout types, yoga and meditations) but even then there is so so much content on there you definitely get your money's worth! Would recommend.",5,1,2020-12-10 02:40:58
"This has been a very easy straight forward app to easy. Good motivation, great exercise and a heaps tasty recipie menu. Like all fitness and health based life choices you only get out of this what you put in. If you do the work, it will deliver.",5,1,2021-06-23 09:59:02
Absolutely love Centr! The amount of exercises and guided recipes makes this one of the more easily navigated fitness programs around. Been with it a bit now and can't wait for more programs to come because Centr 6 has been stellar so far! I also love how everything is adjustable to your fitness level as well.,5,1,2020-04-12 01:00:57
"First time using it. I run, swim, weight lift and ruck run. I would consider myself fit. But I'm trying to lean down and wanted to give this app a go. Great first day. I broke a sweat like crazy and actually had to use my will power to work. I hope to see what else the workouts bring. Great challenge and love the option to self guide or get coached. And the styles of workouts make it convenient for this time in our world. Thank you.",5,1,2020-04-07 00:30:02
"Love the routines, they're 10/10. The workouts are diverse and frequently switch things up to keep things fresh. They are straightforward, and have really taught me how to properly work out. Some QOL changes I would like to see: -Allow me to veiw and browse other routines during my workout, I have to quit my workout right now to veiw others -Give examples of the required tempo for workouts in the preview video. I'm new to specific tempo during workouts, and this would be very beneficial Thx! 💪",4,0,2022-04-30 23:21:00
"Best workout app I've personally used. Ya it's not free but you get what you pay for. Picked it up and haven't put it down. Also has a ton of delicious meals for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and the bonus snacks to help keep you on track to achieve your goals.",5,0,2021-02-21 16:34:20
"Great experience but very limited device pairing. Please allow Fitbit to pair with this app. It's a pain to have to sync Google Fit to Fit to Fit.. then Fit to Fit to Fitbit (tonguetwister!) just to have my data show up on Fitbit. I dont carry my phone while using the app (since I'm watching the trainers) to track all of my steps while exercising, so it would definitely be helpful if you allowed it to pair to Fitbit or other devices.",3,0,2022-07-21 14:04:49
"This is the best fitness app! Been on it for a year and still love it. It has a good variety of different styles of workouts from yoga, pilates, weight lifting, HIIT and much more. There's meal planning, meditation and tools/advice with helpful, healthy information. And the fitness coaches are awesome! Really inspiring, fun and they push you to be your best.",5,3,2023-03-13 14:52:27
First exercise app that gives you everything for a reasonable price. Meal plans generate into a shopping list and they leave past recipes to be used as well. Workouts are fun and easy to follow. The community is great as well.,5,0,2020-05-21 19:34:22
Great fitness app. With an amazing range of workouts. Also love the guided meditatios. However it would be great to integrate with better AI tracking to measure progress. Also the vegan recipes aren't that varied or tasty.,4,0,2022-03-28 05:29:11
"Great exercises for users of all levels. Amazing recipes (which you can swap if you don't like the reccomendated one) from a selection of diet restrictions. Additional bonus features like fitness challenges and meditation. Everything from bodyweight circuits, weight lifting, yoga, functional strength movements. User friendly.",5,2,2022-01-17 20:49:19
"I decided that I needed to get back to my fitness. To feel better about myself, and to make every day activities feel less of a strain on my body. I've always had back troubles, and with the mixture of core, cardio and strength training offered! I feel amazing! Only on my second week of the beginners program. Paid for the year so I can carry on week in week out. A few times a week after my session I go for a run, and each time I feel better and manage a better distance/ time.",5,0,2021-01-17 19:32:27
"Got it free with Amex during lockdown and was sceptical but it's genuinely excellent. The programmes are brilliant, the coaches extremely likeable and entertaining and there's a good mix of different types of workouts. Signed up for another year!",5,0,2022-08-25 02:47:36
"I downloaded this app specifically to try the mediation section. I have been having sleep issues, so I tried the Starry Sleep audio. It was really good. I was relaxed and asleep quickly. Chris should definitely consider doing more of these. Now, due to the cost I probably won't keep the app. Hopefully in the future the app will be more ala cart.",5,7,2020-05-06 23:08:30
Work outs are fantastic and the rage is brilliant. I love the meditations and extended library. The team are great at responding to questions too. The food is a bit alternate for the average working family with kids. I was also a little disappointed at one of the responses I received to a program question but it was understandable for the price and generic nature of the program.,4,1,2020-07-09 10:47:06
"This is the best workout program I have ever done! It has everything you need: workout planner, nutrition plan, meditations, sleep visualizations, informational articles, an amazing community on FB, the trainers are very interactive and a shopping list within the app. Its literally everything you need in a workout program!",5,2,2020-05-10 14:44:44
Excellent starting point to get you back on form. The work outs are roughtly 30min long you can choose the intensity and if you want to do this with ot.r without equipment which makes it perfect for home or gym sessions. What I like best is the centr program which picks the exercises for you as if you have a personal trainer at home. Really got me back into liking exercise n feeling stronger,4,0,2020-06-17 12:05:56
"I absolutely love this app, it's so easy to use and the coaches are amazing. I really look forward to working out everyday, even after my night shifts, the meals are amazing too, I am trying new things everyday and love the way I feel. This app and those behind it, have really helped me change my mindset when it comes to working out and how I see food. 10/10 would recommend.",5,1,2022-12-28 22:37:38
"This app is great! I really like the 6 week workout programs and the meal planning! I wish there were more half hour muscle building workouts but the 50 min ones are great. Just a bit harder to fit into my day. Overall, this is easily the best workout app that I've tried!",5,0,2020-05-25 14:00:55
For some reason I am unable to select one of the subscription options right at the start. It registers the input but nothing happens even after reinstalling or even restarting my phone. I really want to give this app a shot.,1,5,2021-06-23 10:55:30
"Love this app, the range of exercise styles and the programs means I never get bored. The recipes are awesome, and are now some of my favorite things to cook. And the meditations are a great little stress reliever in the middle of the work day.",5,3,2020-08-31 09:08:05
Best Fitness and Health app ever! This is the longest and most consistent I have ever stuck to a fitness regime. Great range of exercise and programs. The recipes are incredible useful as well and have helped immensely with the weekly shopping list.,5,1,2022-08-03 09:07:05
"This program has helped me to stay motivated and concentrated! The different workouts have also helped me to become stronger and change the boring repetition of working out at home. Perfect app, I continuously speak so highly about this app to colleagues, family and friends. Well done",5,0,2020-06-02 23:25:14
"I've never been one for online workouts, but this program is fantastic. As a mum, I love the bite sized work outs are perfect for nap times and use minimal equipment. The planner is great, not only for delicious, quick meals but the shopping list really minimises our food waste. Knowing what meals are coming up also reduces my mental load and life admin so I can focus on what's important.",5,39,2021-06-07 02:34:15
"Great app with lots of go to features. Do wish all workouts included warm-ups and cool downs in each video instead of having to go back to explore for appropriate cool down. Also, please make app available on Roku.",4,0,2022-02-05 23:34:28
"Seemed really good, sad that you have to pay the subscription in one lump fee. Makes things difficult during these times. Had to uninstall. Great quality app from what i experienced, highly satisfied in the diversity of workouts.",4,0,2020-10-17 14:27:24
Centr is motivational and exceptional! I just completed the 6 week program and I didnt think I could do it after the first week. I kicked my heels in and did it! Now I am using the meditations and daily workouts to end and start my day. I wish the meals were a little simpler for a college students budge though.,4,0,2020-07-20 12:39:53
"I love how this app is shaping up my life. Not only does it offers work outs but also meditation, food ideas, and more. I don't use the food recipes as much but the work outs and surprisingly the meditation helps me a lot. Love it! I have lost some weight adding this to my ab workout app.",5,1,2020-04-11 20:31:13
"I love the varied workouts geared to your desired fitness level and goals. The personal trainers are great, and make the workouts fun and challenging. The only reason I am going 4 stars, while I like the meal plans and grocery lists... they can be a bit much. I mean one weeks worth of food and you literally look like you're buying for a restaurant. Would like to see more simplified meals.",4,12,2021-05-14 19:34:26
I love the app with good instructions but it's super hard to use because i don't have access to the internet while i gym so at end i don't use it to practice which is a shame. I wish you create a feature that can enable me to download the videos to watch offline. That's is simply a basic feature I guess,3,0,2022-11-11 09:22:23
"Solid workout app. I like the healthy meal suggestions (albeit I rarely use them 😅), I like the walkthrough workouts (helps with form) and I like the pace. One improvement could be adding a ""back"" control for a sideways view when doing a Self-guided workout.",4,0,2022-08-05 17:59:58
"Ideal app so many options for workouts etc and the set up for meals with the shopping list etc is something I've been looking for for a long time, it makes it a lot easier. They say diet is 70% of the battle to get into shape! The only downfall I've found is that you can't lock your phone while the timer is running.",5,1,2021-11-09 06:04:14
"Find this app great, I've just started to use again due to an injury. It is functional and delivers a great range of workouts for every level. It's a shame I can't utilise all the workouts due to my injury but I still use it as a fitness tool.",4,1,2021-07-03 05:50:18
"Totally recommend a subscription. There are SO many workouts to choose from with various levels of strength/endurance. I love that you can see how long the workout is and for many of the programs, you can see what exercises yoy will be doing ahead of time. Includes recipes too. Great value.",5,3,2020-10-28 13:15:14
"I really enjoy this app. I've been regularly exercising for 20 years but the last 3 I'm injured constantly, problem is I do the same thing too regularly and get in a rut ignoring need for balance and flexibility. The Centr programs really seem to get this mix right and introduce me to hiit and yoga that I've never done as part of the strength program. 6.8k down in 7w and feeling great. My only suggestion is would be good to put in allergies so it doesn't give me recipes I can't eat (seafood)",5,18,2021-02-26 22:23:36
"Compared to other subscription fitness plans I've tried this one gives the most bang for your buck. You'll get workouts, diet, meditation, and fitness tips. The diet is my favorite part. It's low carb, plenty of food, it's flavorful and has plenty of variety. The workouts vary, you won't see the same coach every day and that keeps it interesting. The workouts are based on functional fitness so full body movements are a favorite and most are body weight only. Definitely give this program a try!",5,100,2020-12-27 17:43:30
Add log during workouts is really bad. Please change it to a text box entry. Get rid of the wheel input. Also have the data entered carry over to the next set. Love the app! I just need this feature.,5,2,2021-09-23 02:09:17
"Great app, would be made even better if you could download workouts to the app so you could follow them when having low signal. I worout at a basement so the videos don't load. Sort of like netflix with the downloaded episodes.",4,0,2022-07-24 18:42:18
App is okay but be careful about signing up for the trial. I cancelled my subscription before my trial ended and still got charged. Reached out to the customer service team via email but still haven't received a response after multiple follow ups. Very terrible customer service. Stay away.- Updated as Centr customer service team was finally able to provide refund.,4,4,2020-05-19 02:55:23
Absolutely incredible. So many different choices! Follow the programme set out based on your goals or make your own. Food is incredible and recipes are easy to follow. All the trainers are amazing. Cant praise this app enough! Ps I'm not getting paid to promote the app 🤣 just love it that much,5,20,2021-03-19 16:51:00
"-- Update -- The Centr Team did get back in touch with me and were able to help me out with the subscription. I appreciate their Customer Support team for being understanding and helpful. Updated my review from 1 star to 4. -- Original review -- I signed up for the trial, took a look around, but am unable to use most of the service due to current situations. I missed the date that the trial would convert to a subscription by 1 day (arguably the date was a little obscured) but reached out to the Center team explaining my situation and to ask for a refund since I cannot use the service for the moment. They responded with a very terse response and literally just copied and pasted screenshots of their billing terms. I expected a little more from their team. In the future when I am able to use this service I had planned on rejoining but their approach to this situation has left me reconsidering that. Hopefully their team will be more responsive and I can update this review in the future.",4,11,2020-05-13 23:20:03
Good but too much repetition with exercises that are subbed out for at home options. Given we're 5 months into Covid youd think the options would be more diverse. Additionally the inability for the app to track your progress personally is a big void and what keeps people in Peleton engaged.,3,2,2020-08-05 14:01:36
This app has it all. I was surprised by the amount of recipes included and the ability to filter by vegetarian or meat options. Also there are workout levels for beginners and more advanced.,5,0,2021-01-13 02:30:46
"2 months in and enjoying the Unleased series. App is good but some of the exercises need refining. Also cool downs are generic and don't stretch the areas activated in the workout. If you have 30 minutes a day, this will get you fitter so I recommend it.",4,6,2023-03-06 08:25:35
"I love how nothing is left to guessing. The workouts are very easy to follow. There is also days for stretching, I love how recepies are provided and the shopping list is a killer add-on. Easy to go grocery shopping right after the gym. Every single recepie is so delicious. Also I am very happy that there is meditation sessions at the end of every day. Overall a great app. Grateful to the developers and all the trainers and Chris. Thank you for helping me on my journey to self improvement",5,4,2023-01-26 09:15:55
"Canceled my free trial when it first came out in 2020 and they have been charging me for the last three years a yearly bill of 95 dollars even though I canceled the app and haven't logged in since 2020. Watch out people and check your bank statements. The app is created that you can't cancel through the Google play store but you can sign up through there, it is designed to get people to sign up for the free trial and forget about it while they are charging them.",1,2,2022-05-11 16:43:33
"It's awesome!. Workouts are always changing, I love the meals plan and the app makes it so easy to organize your shopping list and I absolutely love the meditation, specially on these times with the Pandemic it has taken me to places I only have dreamed of. Thank you. 💖",5,4,2020-12-22 14:31:14
"I was a little hesitant to get this app as there are so many free ones out there, but this one is truly comprehensive. The workouts, food, meditation, have such range that I have to say it is well worth the money. I have since replaced my gym membership and feel great without spending all that money.",5,0,2021-01-18 10:54:19
"These workouts are absolutely AWESOME, there are many times I can't get into my local gym sessions due to commitments and these workouts are fantastic to so at home or anywhere you have a spare hour. So easy to follow and always changes it up. The recipes are fab and easy to follow as well.",5,0,2020-07-20 08:11:43
"Great exercise programs, especially for stay at home workouts. I would like more options to customize the weekly planner (if doing a program not have other workouts suggested, etc). But overall a good app.",4,0,2020-05-20 10:04:59
It's good but I wish they would have explained the subscription details properly....I expected to pay a monthly fee of just over £7 a month then found that 93.99 had come out of my account...not happy about this as it's a lot of money to come out all at once when barely employed.,3,27,2020-09-10 06:17:02
"Worth the cost. I have been using this app for two years and I have lost 100lbs. And I haven't even used all the features...needless to say,it works...IF you are disciplined AND consistent. Do the work and transform you mind and body!!! Good luck!",4,0,2022-12-02 14:27:37
I would love to see an easy way to get to your saved workouts and recipes. Maybe a tab at the bottom just for your saved items? Also maybe integration between the recipe and shopping list? A button to add all the ingredients to your shopping list?,4,4,2023-02-09 17:39:30
This is definitely for someone wealthy with a normal schedule. The first meal on the meal planner was red velvet pancakes. Changed the meal for leftovers as with the rest of the meals. Exercises don't start with stretches. I assume they made figured you'd know what to stretch beforehand without knowing the context. I ended up pulling a muscle the first day. Same exercise asked me to do high jumps which I wouldn't do because I have downstairs neighbors and I workout at night. Not worth it.,2,3,2021-09-14 17:50:01
"Overall, I love this app. From the diets to the classes, it's exactly what I need. However, it chews through data. If I could download the workouts in the app and use them, that would help out a lot.",4,4,2021-07-12 14:52:38
"Best fitness app I have. Easy to use, so many options. There are recipes, workout programs at beginner, intermediate and advanced, one off exercises depending on what you want to work/what equipment you have, yoga, pilates,, meditaion and you can add a recipe to your shopping list and it will tell you everything to buy. I can't recommend this enough.",5,1,2022-03-05 09:34:02
"Amazing app to be honest I'm in love with it 😍😁 great diversity in the exercises and focused with a purpose on mind, you can definitely feel that in the workouts 👌 doing the fusion program now and I'm so impressed 🤩 really recommend this app if you're searching for an outside the box app for training, mindfulness and delicious food inspiration 🥰",5,0,2021-02-15 17:38:09
Love this app. Every day is different. Workouts are short but still super intense. Don't get the app if you expect to see Chris everyday. He's not one of the main trainers. I bought the year subscription because I've finally seen the scale go down!,5,0,2020-05-23 19:34:49
"I have been using the app for 2 years and cannot imagine my life without these workouts. They are short, intense and varied so I never get bored. On days when I feel less energetic I do pilates or one of the less bouncy workouts, on days when I want to challenge myself, there is plenty to choose from. I cannot recommend it enough as it gas helped me a lot.",5,0,2022-06-19 12:06:11
"Love the app! Only improvement I'd like is that the self guided workouts and meditations could be chrome cast - I love doing my morning workout on the TV and wish I could follow it with the meditation, or self guided workouts on other days without having to use my phone. Workouts are great, although Ashley doesnt seem as knowledgable as the other trainers (saying to tilt your pelvis in an anterior position in a plank is a bit of a worry 😬)",5,1,2020-05-13 19:04:54
"Lots of variety, suited for different levels and targets. The coaches are great and encouraging. Love it! With ideas for healthy eating, good workouts and meditations for healthy mind, what else could I ask for?",5,1,2020-05-09 09:08:25
"Hemsworth not got enough money as it is ey? Website ridiculous to use, couldn't access account settings to cancel, still been charged can't get a refund.

"It's good for home workouts, haven't taken it to the gym yet. Recipes are nice. Only issue I have there is when I check a recipe then go back to check another - the app scrolls me back to the top, so I have to scroll past everything I have already passed. But as far as a fitness app goes - highly recommended.",5,0,2022-02-10 15:57:28

"I can't log in. I created my account on chrome. Then when I tried to log in on the app several times it crashed or it ""drop a dumbbell"". So far pretty disappointing for such an expensive app. Probably I will be canceling my subscription few days on the trial.",2,3,2020-03-25 01:19:23
One month in and I love this app. First time I have ever been consistent with a workout routine. I like how everyday is a new exercise and that there is a setting for beginners (like me). Longest workout is 40 minutes which is all I can handle for now. Looking forward to using this more and getting to that next level!,5,2,2023-01-27 14:12:40

We love the variety of trainers, programs and meal plans. It makes working out fun as you feel like you get to know the trainers as well! We will continue to use Centr as it is incredibly reasonably priced, has a huge library and is always adding new content and my wife and I are (most importantly) seeing results in fitness and strength.",5,43,2020-11-07 10:13:51
"This is an excellent, comprehensive program. By far the best ""lifestyle"" or workout app I've used. I second the suggestion for having a place to log weights during the lifting workouts, though. This app is worth the money, even if you don't have much money to spare.",5,2,2021-01-19 03:01:34
"So so greatful for this experience! It's been more than three years I'm using the app, through rough times, injuries and depression, through good and happy times too!

It is a pretty awesome app. I like that the meal plans can become a shopping list. I wish that you can add your calories per day when you can't go shopping for the food listed but its still a good app.,5,0,2020-06-04 19:35:24
"I actually wanted to buy the yearly subscription for this app, I am a fitness geek but i really signed up for the meal plans they had in store, but in my opinion, meal plans and diet can be more productive if there are videos, and also more communication in between the trainers and the clients. And all the food stuff applies only to people living in the USA as the ingredients are usually for richer people who can actually get it🤣 so thats a no for me",2,1,2022-05-15 05:16:05

"This app is everything I was looking for. After working/training with USMIL SOF/NSW and being spoon fed from the healthy food provided, I needed an app like this to help me pick up my health focused journey towards strength and well-being that Chris's team created. The diverse training, program goals/intensities, and dietary needs/restrictions are just a few of the unique options one can tailor to their needs. Daily meditations and meal shopping list are fav tools to fuel one's progress.",5,9,2021-05-10 23:26:35
I really love the app. Lots of different varieties especially if you dont have equipment. My only wish was that there was a program for people who do have weights and equipment at home. Lots of individual work outs but would love something structured like the centre 6 program.,5,0,2020-06-15 20:06:55
"This app I find different from other workout apps because of the many options of food,exercises and they even have meditations which I find very important for people to have, I love that in exercises they have the classic exercises and something that I have never found in these apps which is martial arts exercises, I have a lot of interest in practicing martial arts so for people who love mma, boxing. I'd recommend this app to them without a thought If they were looking to try out an app.",5,0,2021-05-29 11:46:45

Can't even explore the app without agreeing to pay after the free trial finishes. No idea what I'm agreeing to pay for. Would really like to be able to look at it and see what is on offer. Edit/ spelling. Cheers for the reply. Will have a solid look then! Rating changed,5,2,2020-05-01 09:43:48

Best health and fitness app I've ever used. Only reason for 4 stars is the weird bug on Android that makes switching to landscape mode during a workout really hard (switches between portrait and landscape rapidly).,4,1,2020-05-06 10:58:39
Love this app! Best online workout routines and couches I've found. I used to do athlean x and liked it but felt stuck. I prefer this for workout. The meal prep and setup is unreal. Best by far. Love the incorporation of mediation and articles on fitness too. I only wish it would incorporate rest days.,5,15,2021-03-29 23:01:02

Great potential After years of using programs like Beach Body for home workouts I am a little underwhelmed by the coach guided workouts. These seem like banks of workouts pieced together to create a routine... I feel like results could be better if the guided workouts were actually guided by someone doing them. During one workout it appears that the same clip was just spliced together over and over as you can see the same person walk through the background over and over..,4,1,2020-04-03 18:58:18
"The app asks you what equipment you have, purportedly to create customized work out plans. However, that is not the case as the app is scheduling workouts for equipment that I don't possess. Additionally, there is little guidance in actually establishing a sustainable workout regimen. I have a free 1 year membership but would certainly not pay the $120 per year for this level of content and support.",2,3,2023-01-26 23:15:37

Cannot reccomend the app enough.",5,0,2021-08-29 07:48:47
"The app itself wasn't the worst but the service and all customer representatives we're rude and unhelpful. I was charged for this app on day 6 of the 7 day trial so don't be tricked into believing you get a full free 7 day trial.

It's a good app. It would be better if I could download workouts as I work in a regional town with limited network capability and can't use 4G or wifi in certain spots. Otherwise great programs.,4,3,2022-01-17 05:25:45
I signed up and did the Centr 6 program. I am so excited to progress to the new levels because that was easy to stick to and showed awesome results. I've been talking it up to everyone who is interested in an at-home workout program.,5,0,2020-06-06 00:56:30
"It is amazing and includes meals, many different workouts for different activity levels, meditation sessions, sleep aids and more. I use this app every single day and it has changed my life. I love this app.",5,0,2020-06-10 11:39:27
"Very troubled by their renewal process whereby they automatically charge another year's subscription without notifying you in advance that your membership is ending. They could at least send a little reminder to be fair and upfront but nope, totally scammed me on this with no recourse!",1,40,2021-07-06 15:54:19
"Love the motivation throughout the workouts and explaining how to do the set at a lower level if required. The food is awesome, love the recipies. It would be amazing if it had a progress tracker or linqed to something like myfitness app.",5,1,2020-08-12 20:49:44
"Signed up the 6 week trial but used it twice. No email too say the trial was coming to an end instead they charge the account. Understand this is more likely in their terms and conditions but looking at the other comments I am not the only one that is not happy with this. Offer a free trial to seem all sympathetic to the current situation but knowing people will forget to cancel, dont give warning and then take their money, more like taking advantage of this situation.",1,10,2020-05-14 11:41:16
"This is absolutely the best strength training and nutrition and recipes available right now. This is the RIGHT way to strength train and eat!! I have had great results, especially from the third piece that I never knew how much I needed... Meditation and mindfulness. This is so well rounded!",5,3,2021-01-21 23:30:18
"It's excellent in so many ways. 👍 I especially if, like me, you feel motivated to work out an excercise but never know what to do. Pick a programme an off you go. Plus all the other extras like diet, meditation & stretching. They should employ me I recommend them so much lol.",5,1,2022-11-29 10:14:59
"Buyers remorse. For the price of an actual gym membership, what you get are videos of guided workouts, and healthy recipes. All things that you can get for free on many other online platforms. I'll be canceling my subscription. Unfortunately they don't give refunds.",2,4,2020-01-01 22:22:37
"This is one of the only fitness apps you need. It came at a perfect time for me when all the gyms were closed. I'm someone who already worked out at a minimum 5 days a week. I do the Centr6 program, and I'm on week 5. Noticing great results. Diet is an important part, which the app also helps with. But the workouts are genuinely hard. I do them in my hot garage, making them even harder. Each workout is a killer. If you think it's easy - that's your own fault.",5,7,2020-07-06 22:23:37
"Hands down the best fitness subscription on the market. There is plenty of workouts for anyone at every level of fitness. The meal plan is one of the biggest highlights of the program. Paired with the wonderful Facebook community, there is no better subscription, which is absolutely worth every penny.",5,3,2021-11-19 03:35:53
"I have subscribed since the beginning, I was overweight and I can say that this app save me, motivate me to do more workouts, to give the best of myself and obove all to never give up. In this we have everything, workouts, meditation, yoga, pilates, receipts, etc....thank you to all the coaches 😃 and for making my life easier and better",5,32,2021-07-19 19:01:54
I love to work out! During this pandemic I was not able to see the gym in 2 months and found some sort of method of working out with little results. When I ran across this app and tried the free trial I knew that this would be the game changer for me. You do you not need gym equipment to get results. I have a few dumbbells and a barbell to do what I need to do in the comfort of my backyard. Plus I'm saving money from my gym membership by signing up for the yearly plan.,5,1,2020-05-18 15:09:04
"The App is great and have lots of nice workouts, unfortunately the audios are prerecorded and you can hear all the same comments and jokes over and over in different routines, I do 2 programs per day and sometimes I get the same comments and jokes (in both programs) even though they are different programs and the same day, what makes it bit boring and repetitive for a high rate app, need to invest in individual audio for each program and not use the same in each exercise. Apart from, awsome app",4,1,2023-01-10 08:26:44
"Some good home sessions on here but many require equipment. Some sessions don't have sound, too often repeat warm up and cool downs. But on the whole it is better than many similar apps out there.",3,2,2020-07-14 12:25:23
I love this app! The workouts are achievable but strong with lots of options for modifications and plenty of different programs depending on your fitness. The recipes are yummy and the meal planner super simple to follow and modify. I love it. I've tried many programs over the years and this is by far my favourite.,5,6,2023-02-19 20:29:12
This app could be really good if someone actually put more effort into balanced programs & meal plans. I have completed 1 week of the unleashed beginners program. Warm up & stretching is the same every session (boring) & the upper body exercises overload the shoulders on a daily basis that it is likely to result in injury. You pretty much need a full home gym for the other programs which is also a big problem. The recipes also need special ingredients & majority are not family friendly.,2,2,2022-01-18 13:19:56
"Couldn't be happier with the variety of exercises and coaches, meals, plans, meditation, and overall wellness approach. My biggest criticism is that there aren't modifications for the least flexibility or fit, or for people who are recovering from injuries. However the community in the Facebook group are a huge source of info and inspiration. Videos need closed captions. This app is a daily part of my life!",5,45,2021-04-03 19:53:37
"I love this app!! I had been struggling trying to get into a workout routine the last few months. I have a gym in my basement but I get bored trying to come up with workouts. The daily schedule on the app takes the thought out of it, and I love the variety of the workouts. Would definitely recommend.",5,0,2021-12-23 23:42:30
"Puts all the tools within reach, literally, for living healthier and in shape. The suggested recipes, along with the built-in shopping list, not to mention the quick workouts you can fit into any schedule, eliminates all the excuses. It did for me anyway. If YOU want to feel 🎶better, stronger, faster, thinner,🎶 and never make it to the gym.. congrats the gym found you. 💪",5,9,2020-09-14 21:59:54
!!!CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION!!! They won't refund if you forget to cancel and they don't warn you when they charge your account automatically. I contacted customer supporting a day after being charged another yearly fee and they refuse to refund any amount. This is an absolutely digusting practice and is completely not fair on consumers. Raising a complaint with the ACC. Edit: Deloper tells me to email in a response as per below. I had already emailed but emailed again. Still nothing.,1,7,2022-10-21 11:31:54
"This is the best lifestyle app I've ever purchased. The food is fantastic, the exercises are great, and the meditation is inspiring. I've never had an issue with the functionality; app is responsive and user friendly. I recommend this to anyone that will listen! You will not be disappointed!",5,1,2022-08-08 05:04:24
My laptop died one morning when I was getting ready to do my morning centr workout. Luckily I remembered I can quickly download the app. In the middle of lockdown this app has saved my wellbeing. It has everything to the workout of your choice and a nice meditation to get you through the day. In the state of the world at the moment it is so nice to take control of your peace with this app!,5,2,2021-08-24 23:11:06
"Such a good work out app!!! I'm not the type to post reviews but I gotta give it to these guys they really put a lot of effort into this project (app) they have a huge variety of workouts, meals plans etc. I was looking for a good workout app for a long time and I finally found it. Absolutely recommend this one! 10/10",5,0,2022-01-24 00:15:03
"So far so good. I would like to see more sport specific training as I have just started BJJ and a strength and conditioning program would be beneficial but, I understand that to cater for everyone specifically would be asking too much. Still a 5 star training app!",5,0,2022-06-27 17:40:01
"Love this app! I've used it for over a year and it's the only program that has successfully helped me get in shape. Both the workouts and the recipes are great. Super yummy food, many vegetarian options, and you don't have to worry about feeling hungry if you follow the plan.",5,0,2023-02-17 17:36:06
This has greatly improved from when I first started. The exercises and sets have helped me immensly in the last few months lse weight (30kg) and now that you can switch options I find it even easier to use. Masterfully done,5,2,2021-02-05 23:23:08
"Honestly, I love it. I've been an athlete my entire life, and even went out for some Personal Training certifications in my early 20s. So i've never really struggled to come up with stuff in the gym, i've always known what's going on and how to do it. What's really great about Centr is it's ecosystem of features all in one place. The workouts are great, usually pretty straight forward HIIT workouts that will get the job done. Each day, you get meal recipes that are delicious, healthy, and easy to makes. The app suggests a variety of meditations for you to work through. I honestly wouldn't describe Centr as a fitness app, I would call it a Lifestyle app. If you want to eat healthier, get in shape, stay calm, and feel more... Centr'd (sorry)... this is the app for you. Highly recommend.",5,21,2020-04-26 19:00:27
"Love this app! The workouts are awesome with breakdowns on form and reps. The meals are great and easy to use, prep and swap. I never thought of trying meditation but figured I'd give it a try and I'm glad I did. This is by far my favorite app and workout regimen. Shout out and huge thanks to Chris Hemsworth and his entire team! Thank you guys/ladies! It's been worth every penny!",5,0,2022-02-13 17:29:01
"I've been primarily using the open as a newbie to weightlifting and to get some good MMA Drills going. I've loved my experience and have no noticed an increase in my skill, strength, and stamina. Not to mention that I have gotten some good recipes out of it. It helps you sort by diet, what equipment you have, or what trainer you prefer. Highly recommend.",5,3,2020-06-25 19:44:22
The results in my body over the course of 3 weeks have been better than me going to the gym. This app and its programs are well worth my money with the results I'm getting. I cant wait to see the results after 3 -6 months. I'm now looking forward to the pains to get the gains and also theres a great support group on Facebook that share their own progress and tips. I'm definitely a follower now. LETS GET IT LEGENDS!...,5,7,2020-09-03 07:44:02
"I've been using this app for a year now and find it amazing! The programs, workouts, articles and recipes feel real and when followed produce real results. I enjoy that there are no marketing or adds interrupting workouts, before or after.",5,1,2023-01-24 12:09:35
"Love this app, I find it easy to follow with plenty of options. Being a football player (soccer) I wondered if there could be something on this app that could help me get my cardio up. Iv tried the hiit class programme but just wanting something else that could help me get 90mins on a football pitch. You don't ask you don't find out right?",4,0,2022-09-08 06:44:30
"As an overweight individual, struggling to find a workout program that is easy to start was difficult. This program (teaches) how to workout while encouraging pace management while balancing growth in the uncomfortable. I have been using the program for almost three weeks and, I am still at it. I what to thank Chris and his team for creating a workout lifestyle training program that is helpful to ALL people and body types.",5,7,2021-01-22 03:25:37
"Been fantastic!!! I haven't worked out in years and this program has helped pick me up where I was and walked me every step, nothing was too hard to where I would hurt my self or too easy where I wouldn't get any results. AMAZING app, program and people. It is for everyone!!!",5,0,2023-01-08 20:08:48
"I didn't think that this was going to be for me but I was wrong. I'm more of a beginner than intermediate in fitness training. I did the 6 weeks free trial and have now signed up for an additional 3 months. I just wish that they had more yoga available and maybe a ""plan"" aimed more for the mornings as this is when I work out. The meal plans are good too!",5,14,2021-02-18 06:44:41
First 4 weeks completed. So far so good. Very impressive holistic approach towards healthy living packed in one app! Liked the variety of the programs. Quality is a top notch in everything. Keep it up! Thank you team!,5,0,2022-02-25 04:22:58
"When I first got this app it was just to start 7 Day trial. I like to try different trials but not really commit to anything. What really stood out from other apps is that Centr didn't ask for my height or my weight. It started by asking what I was looking for whether it was weight loss, toning, or building muscle. The recipes on here are actually delicious and helpful. You can swap out and keep track of what you eat, the workouts you do, and meditations. And let me tell you, meditation works.",5,0,2022-06-17 14:48:12
"I've been using for 5 weeks and have been enjoying how easy it is to setup a workout routine with the different programs and how I can add a specific workout to my week to fill in any extra days. The meal program makes eating better really easy, even if you want to start small with only a couple meals for the week.",5,0,2022-09-01 10:46:04
"Amazing!!! I'm 10 months postpartum! I started this about a month ago. I found after having my daughter I felt run down, dropped things constantly, was clumsy, lacked energy, got angry a lot, and just generally felt like poo... I was worried I had PPD. I went to my doctor before, to ensure I was ok... Was given all this help and told to work out. I started doing these work outs and everything has improved. Thank you!!! So much. These are amazing. Easy to follow, fast, fun and rewarding!!!!",5,34,2020-08-27 17:13:29
"I'm a truck driver, I've lost about 10 lbs in a month while using this app, I try to do at least 2-3 workouts a week but it's kinda tough doing that on the road. Also not being able to cook the meal plan sucks but I changed my usual road food with oatmeal with bananas and raw walnut in the morning and salads and rice with tuna throughout the day. Thanks to Chris and his team for such a great app",5,0,2022-05-13 02:01:08
"Love love love this app! As a busy mum of 3 kids I don't have time to go to the gym, this allows me to workout at home and still get amazing results. Centr has totally simplified my life, I get my workout, meals and meditation in the one place. The shopping list makes it so easy and gives me the flexibility to change out meals to suit my family.",5,1,2020-02-14 06:25:00
"Love the workouts, but app could do with a little work to make it more user-friendly, such as: - option to plan out week of training so you can get a reminder on the day of your session - replace workout of the day with workout from your chosen program/personalised page for your program - option to edit logs to make notes or edit incorrect weights - option to choose substitution exercise and add weights for that - keep rest timer running if opening a different app - louder beeps at end of rest.",4,0,2022-11-16 04:52:39
"I earned a promo code to try it out, got hooked on the 1st week! Tailored workouts, meal plan, wellness suggestions all-in-one! Sadly for the promo code, there is no redemption anywhere in the App, so I contacted support and they told me the fix is through the Web App! Excellent service! Will definitely resubscribe",5,1,2022-12-21 05:50:21
"I love everything about this app! The meal planning is phenomenal and the workouts will kick your butt..but in a good way 😁 The plan is easy to follow and I love the relaxation stories. There are daily reading activities and pep talk articles as well. Best of all, while you are getting your workout on, you are making donations that impact a child's life in a very big way!! Kudos to the team!! You guys are the best!!❤️❤️",5,1,2023-02-08 03:13:54
Very good app and variety of training programs. I've typically been a heavy lifter but I am in the middle of ignite intermediate to try something different and complete a phase with a focus on resistance but with a cardio emphasis.,5,0,2022-08-28 06:16:33

"Absolutely amazing app! I tried a few other fitness apps and programs and this one is by far the best. The trainers are amazing and so is the meal plan. Everything is laid out perfectly in a daily planner so it's very easy to follow. The online community is so supportive and motivating. It's like a second family. Centr also listens to any concerns and immediately addresses them. I highly recommend this app. It is truly life changing. Come join the Centr legend family, you won't forget it!",5,23,2020-02-14 12:22:35
"I started during covid 19, suffered nerve damage, autoimmune disease and over weight. I had 4 boys and started working out with them else where and then needed something more for me. So started Centr, I love it. I do it daily and feel the strength in my body. I have a while to go before I would consider myself strong but I'm doing things with my kids that I couldn't before. ❤️",5,0,2020-05-26 00:56:05

"Fantastic!!! I love this app. The guided workouts and no guided workouts, yoga, mediation, meal and snack ideas. There is so much here. Not just for adults but kids too. They pack a ton of content into this app for a very reasonable price. I would recommend this app to anyone looking to get in shape or trying to stay active while maintaining social distance. This is a great product. Highly recommend. Thank you to everyone involved in creating this.",5,4,2020-07-14 19:48:03
"As someone with previous weight lifting experience and in decent shape I have to say I am more than impressed with these workouts! I absolutely live the HIIT, HILIT, and PLYO workouts! I have also enjoyed the meals and the detailed shopping list feature that you can easily adjust. I was a chef for 15 years and a certified nutritionist and everything is on point for thus program. The whole app is very well thought out and easy to use/ swap meals or workouts any day of the week! Thanks Centr!!!!!",5,1,2022-10-09 17:44:32
"It's the BEST! It has a TON of variety in workouts! So whatever you are in to as far as fitness goes, they've got you covered. And they have uncoached and coached workouts! It's like having a personal trainer in your pocket 24/7. They also have a comprehensive meal guide with recipes! AND you can customize your meal plan based on pretty much whatever common specialized diet you might be on! My only improvement would be to have a wider variety of commentary. The jokes get old after a while.",5,6,2020-06-18 22:09:22
"Not happy. They don't tell you how much the price is before you sign up and give them your email address. I used an address I only use for apps like this. Then it's very expensive £22 something a month but they don't tell you what you get for your money. Reminds me of those pushy gyms where they won't tell you the price until they've given you a tour, bribed you with coffee or smoothies and sit you in an office so you can't just walk out.",1,3,2022-07-09 20:26:09
"This app is just great. I am thinking of cancelling my gym membership because i think this is more worthwhile. Lots of different kinds of workouts to choose from including. Boxing,pilates ,yoga,MMA, aerobics. Take your pick . Loving the fact that i dont have to think what to cook anymore. This app is doing that job for me. I usually dont stick to meal plans but the recipes are so good i look forward to trying each one. Really enjoying this . Thanks centr.",5,9,2020-02-16 20:52:26
"I never review apps until now. I've cancelled my gym membership. This is the real deal. Great workouts which keep on changing and dont get boring, entertaining instructors and a whole bunch of other stuff. Was a bit pissed I didnt get my 6 weeks free as promised by Hemsworth himself, but was ok to pay to keep on using it. Defo worth the money in my opinion for anyone who wants to work out at home. Thanks guys.",5,1,2020-07-23 22:22:55

They said, they won't be able to issue a refund and guided to contact centr app developers. I contacted centr app developers and they refused to refund the amount. They charged me 122$ for the app which I am never going to use. I felt scammed since advertisement was for trial and they charged me for full year immediately.",1,9,2023-02-19 16:15:40
"For the first time in my life, I have intrinsic motivation to workout everyday. The workouts are full body, no two workouts are alike, and the couched sessions feel like you have a personal trainer. Furthermore, their daily meditations have carried me through this pandemic. While I haven't stuck with the meal planning they provide, I have tried a number of the recipes. They're delicous!",5,13,2020-09-23 05:39:25
"This app is AMAZING! You have everything at your fingertips (literally)! You have a planner with your workout, meal plan, a meditation, and tons of nutritional and fitness related articles in the blog. You also have a ton of delicious recipes for meals and snacks (even my 15yr old daughter loves them!). You also have access to an amazing community of totally awesome people going through the same process you are, who are highly motivating. Its like having a family that is totally behind you!",5,3,2020-02-15 15:35:25
I have struggled to find an exercise routine that I could stick with for more than a month. I've been using centr for 2 months now and I'm loving the different trainers. Center 6 was a great program to get started with and now that I've finished it I'm loving the planner and how it picks great workouts for me. My only suggestion is to get more meditations by Taika Waititi.,5,3,2020-05-08 15:16:07
"The app is not great and very pricey. I would not recommend it as the content is not worth paying for. I learned about it because I did some training with a friend also using the free trial. I think there are other apps for training (Freeletics, Nike Training Club), Meditation (headSpace and calm) and yoga (DownDog) that are 10x better. They treat users poorly and try to steal money out of you. What makes this company and service so terrible is their immoral Customer Support. They ignore 50% of my emails, stop answering when they are not pleased, send the same template answer time after time. They make it so hard to cancel, and when you realised you had been charge, there is absolutely NO way to get reimbursed. After the end of my not-used free trial, I emailed them and was very frank. ""You can look in my profile. I have NOT used your app a single time in the last month. I forget to cancel my free trial. I contacted you as soon as I have seen the charge on my credit card. This is a mistake on my side; I forgot to cancel it on time. Could you please reimburse me? I didn't use it, and I am not planning to use it anymore"" and from there dozens of emails without any help. Their policy ""it's written that we don't do reimbursement"". I tried to argue on common sense ""Look, I never used the app - don't plan to use it in the future. I am not happy with it, and if I paid, I would ask for reimbursement because I don't think it's worth paying. Now, what is the value for you to have an unhappy customer who is not happy about your product, not using and don't want to pay for it and is charged anyway"". The app is about mental health and well-being but is only about squeezing money out of you, answering you poorly, and treating you like poo. It's hard for me to see a company that treats their customer with that much disdain to succeed in the future but let's see. From what you can read online in Google and the review, they have turned almost all of their users into detractors.",1,3,2021-09-01 13:30:11
"Great. Mid 30's. Worked out most of my life. Endurance running, boxing, weight lifting, swimming. Covid took that for a turn and after a while all workout experiences at home failed. (Cali so fires as well). Got cntr for around $11 per month. At first did it to guilt myself, but found it surprisingly effective in getting my heart rate going and doing a decent amount of muscle work without weights..while.keeping it interesting. Appreciate the tips on diet as well if you're not used to it",5,0,2020-09-15 03:03:05
Second to none! I have been using Centr since its release date and I have to admit the changes that they've made to update the app and provide more value has truly been amazing. I initially loved the idea of having the coaches of A list celebrities in my back pocket and that is exactly what I got! Not only is this a fitness app but a complete solution to living a healthy active lifestyle. I really cannot recommend this app more and I hope that you get as much value out of it as I have!,5,4,2020-10-29 06:23:55
"Nice program and you definitely see results. But it's a little confusing at first, as they have programs and daily routines. So do you do both? Or just a program? And which program? Whats the pros and cons, and could some of the daily weight routines be blended with their separate 6 week programs? And they provide meal suggestions, but what should my target portion size and calorie intake be for my goals? It gives the same meals regardless of if you want to tone or build muscle. But still good",4,0,2020-06-16 12:47:16
"First day, it was a hard thought for me to buy a monthly subscription for this app.. Now I'm a bit thankful that I am paying them my money. My first day of work out was a rough start. 12 steps and 8 videos per session, and working out all of them for an hour. The fitness is worth it, the next day my arms hurt Hella bad cause I never pushed my muscles, now I'm starting to see a difference! They have diet system as well that you can follow. It's definitely worth every drop if you can afford it.",5,34,2020-10-02 17:37:13
"Phenomenal program. For someone who likes to workout but never plans workouts, either from poor organization or lack of knowledge. I am a military member who is slightly fit. I would say overall good but not great. I feel like this program is going to take me to the great level because it is all laid out. Also, if I feel like doing weights l I can swap over to a workout from their catalog. If I have little time, I press on with the Centr 6 program. I started with 6 weeks and now annual member",5,20,2021-02-22 16:55:39
"Not only does it tell me what to do and when to do it AND how to make it, but it also allows me to adjust the planner to fit my schedule. What more could you ask for! Delicious meal planning, workouts for all different goals and fitness levels, and the ability to adjust as needed. I guess I really didn't need Chris, just his team! Thank you Centr!!!!",5,25,2021-04-21 22:00:29
"Even the beginner level is no joke! It's working me to the core! All the programs, meditations, food plans.. etc, are great! Definitely would recommend. Worth the price.",5,1,2023-04-08 01:43:54
I over all love this app! This app really works well with my schedule and has helped me with my horrible chronic pain. I love that I don't need to get in my car and drive to the gym. I also really appreciate the guided Work-outs. The only thing I would love to see is an option to add an extra work out a day in the planner. In the mornings I usually do a Yoga or Pilates session then at night I do the planned work-out. It would be great if I could plan them both in the daily planner.,5,0,2020-12-14 13:05:36
"Great! I used to train 5/7 days in the gym, but due to the quarenting, my routine got highly impacted. I started to do my own routines at home but I got out of focus, making difficult to keep a high intensity. CNTR help me to keep the focus and intensity of my workouts, and as well help me to learn new workouts and recepies that I will keep using in the future With commitment you will get some pretty good results for sure If you want to look like THOR you will need to work a little bit more😅",5,0,2020-06-01 11:27:45
The last update keeps signing me off. I just can't use the app for almost a week now,1,3,2023-08-26 23:55:39
Love the workouts. They make it super easy to follow along and get a good though workout in,5,0,2023-08-07 11:53:40
I love the variety of workouts and trainers. I look forward to seeing what the workout of the day is. I also love having the option to find a workout that is more suited to my needs that day. With three young kids I'm sometimes (always) time poor and sleep poor. I like being able to choose a slower workout on days I haven't had good rest or shorter workouts on days I just can't fit a longer one in amongst the chaos. I am way more consistent with my workouts because of this.,5,1,2022-01-22 21:48:09
"Comprehensive Health App. This app is literally everything I need to stay fit at home. Recipes, meditations, various workouts both coached and self guided. Their Centr 6 week programs are fantastic. My ONLY complaint is that there is no leniency in pausing the membership. I broke my tailbone and was out for 4 months. I contacted the team who advised me that it wasn't possible to suspend the membership and I thought that was really unfair. I could have supplied a hospital certificate.",5,19,2021-01-01 01:37:15
"I really like this app! I started using it not long ago, but I think I'm going to stick to it for a few months. Perhaps it's just me, but I can't find a way to customise my planner. E.G. I subscribed on Sunday evening and I couldn't do the initial Sunday training. Then on Monday I had a new plan to follow. So I was looking for a way to switch the days/trainings around but couldn't find anything. Another thing I miss is a WearOS link. That'd be great!",4,19,2021-02-08 18:05:05
This app is superb. You get real insight from Chris Hemsworth's actual trainers and friends in the fitness/wellness industry. The workouts are easy and the recipes are delicious. The shopping list feature is very handy. The only negative is that I would like some more recipes that can be made in under 30 min and/or use less ingredients.,4,1,2020-06-11 15:23:00
"Do not use this app or business. I have been unable to have my account deleted. They say to send my details but I have already done that at least six times. Definitely not putting them in this review. Deleting an account should be simple but that's not the case with Centr. Once they have your details, they have them forever unless you are in the UK. The recent offer of a temporary free membership was nothing more than a phishing expedition.",1,3,2020-05-20 22:57:07
"Good variety of classes showing adaptations for some movements, plus classes using bodyweight or freeweights. You can choose one of the programmes or simply follow the daily planner for exercises. Daily planner includes meal plan which you can scale per person. You can select whether you are vegan, vegetarian, pescatarian or omnivore and whether you want to lose weight, build muscle or toned and fit. My gripe with the meals recipes is that the ingredients are not always easy to find in the UK.",4,13,2021-03-07 08:27:23
I've been using this for 20days and I'm already feeling more alive and healthy. Everything is great about this app and recipes are good too (tho the estimated time is always way less than actual time it takes me to prepare and cook the meal). Also it would be great if the app asked for my body states (like weight and height) and what is my goal. But overall I loved this app so much 😍,5,12,2021-08-22 15:14:14
The only fitness app i've stuck with. Coached workouts make it 100 x better. Sculpted is 11/10 👌🏼,5,0,2023-06-04 21:00:13
"Zero notifications which is appalling. Had free subscription through cc provider and signed up on website, not the app. Logged in only once but never received any subscription emails so had no idea it was set to auto renewal until charge on my card. I explained the circumstances and they have been the first company I've ever dealt with who refused to refund and it's a whole year. Not a single email from Centr for a year so forgot I even signed up so how would I even know auto-renewal existed?",1,5,2023-03-02 04:47:36
"I've tried a number of workout apps throughout the years and always got bored very quickly, finding it hard to keep myself going. I struggle to workout to begin with, but I figured if I paid for Centr, I could somehow convince myself to try and look like Thor. I'm a long way from that, but the huge variety of trainers, programs, workouts, etc. really makes it easy to stay engaged. I'm a little over a month in now and don't feel at all like giving up, so I would recommend Centr to anyone like me.",5,1,2022-02-02 00:11:05
"Something that works. For once I am able to shift the weight and get stronger without sacrificing tasty meals, which the app provides recipes for. The recipes are great and straight forward, the workouts are great to follow and the community on Facebook is a great places to talk and share, including when the trainers from the app also post and talk to the people. Now if you excuse me, I have a session with Da Rulk 😅",5,17,2021-03-04 16:42:14
"Going good. One thing is slow down between transitioning from one exercise to another to let us fatty's keep up. Netherless, great variety of work outs ( just finished the centr 6) and don't think I'll ever get bored. Beats doing 10 burpees in between add breaks, five times a day to not chunk up and stay fit during hibernation. Once the government gives me more money, I'll be able to start the diet part. 😁😀🤘🤜👍",5,1,2020-04-20 09:42:26
"Easy to use, easy to find things or search up, if you need help it's there, great little app!! I love the workouts!! Feel great pumped, sexy and confident all day long, I see my body improving, foods are delicious and I want to keep going with these coached workouts. Thanks for a great app!!",5,3,2023-03-12 00:05:48
"Absolutely fantastic. I started with a 6 week trial and saw such great results and feel so much stronger, fitter and leaner that I've just signed up for a year's membership. It's such a motivational program, easy to follow exercises, has a meal plan, you can choose your goals and at so much less than a gym membership or personal trainer. This is the same team that gets Chris Hemsworth into shape and they're certainly getting me into shape too.",5,0,2020-05-20 12:17:54
"I downloaded the app on Saturday, have been following my daily programs since then. I must admit, I didnt like going to the gym because I didnt know what to do and it does scare off a lot of people. With the pre planned week ahead and dieting Centr offers, it is well worth the monthly/quarterly/yearly subscription. I wish i could write more but im limited to 500 words 😅. Chris and the team have done exceptionally well on this app! Thank you guys for creating this!!!",5,5,2020-10-06 09:50:10
"Lots of workouts, tons of easy meals with lots of flavor and the shopping tool is quick and simple. I like nightime winddown mediation too. Best part is the workouts are done by trainers who engage the whole time, they make it fun. Love the app!",4,0,2020-06-11 21:42:58
"Worth the price! With the combination of the workouts and the meal plan, I began to see results from the first week. I used to workout an hour or more and didn't see as much result. Plus, as a vegan, the recipes are delicious! (And that is not that easy...)",5,2,2020-04-07 12:52:32
Terrible experience... Downloaded the app to try out the free 7 day trial. Didn't even use the app and after 7 days from the download they charged me for the year and won't give me a refund. Bad experience. Don't download unless you want to get gouged for $165.00. Don't even download this app unless you want to pay for it.,1,20,2020-03-03 00:13:16
Great app. I tried out the 6 week free trial and used the app for about 2 weeks. Now I'm no longer using it and got charged for 120 USD and there is nothing I can do about it. At least a notification telling me the free trial was about to end and I was going to pay for a full year would be nice.,1,3,2020-05-27 23:22:26
"Comprehensive app. The work outs are great, I am seeing real results that other training programs have not provided. The meals are actually delicious and easy. Really impressed with the app and Centr experience!",5,0,2020-05-29 05:40:25
"This app is amazing! The work-outs are really good, and easy to do at home without the need of fancy equipment! Also the duration is brilliant, not too long, not too short so you always find the time to exercise!",5,1,2020-04-25 11:09:35
Really easy to follow workouts. Simple to change out workouts and recipes. The shopping list is an excellent feature!! So great to have meal nutrition and workouts all in the same app and amazingly user friendly!,5,0,2020-09-20 03:26:35
"I find it is three serivces in one , Amazing work out plans , great meal ideas , and a meditation section that is one of the better ones I've used. The only piece that is missing is a work out rep/set tracker. Its is worth the money spent though.",4,0,2020-06-12 02:02:17
"The Centr App is fantastic, so easy to plan your week and exercise where ever you are. The Meal Planner is brillant with so many dietary options to work, with plus the ability to swap meals in and out of the planner which you can instantly add to the Shopping List. The Meditation and Sleep Visualizations means one app covers it all. Well done Centr Team for an App that is perfect to get you to your fit and healty self!",5,1,2020-02-14 23:21:21
"Be careful with this app. It consumes a lot of internet data. In 3 weeks using the app, it used almost 18GB of my internet data. When talking to the customer service team, I had a bizarre answer that the app streams the video, which is expected, but consuming all this data is bizarre. I watch videos on YouTube everyday day and it does not consume 15% of that internet data.",2,10,2022-02-03 20:09:45
"Absolutely amazing! Subscribed for 1 month, then cancelled and subscribed for a whole year. The workout variations are incredible and I have found myself in a great weekly routine and also stacked up some muscle!",5,1,2021-03-03 07:07:55
"Wonder full app the work outs are challenging with put being daunting, the meals are delicious, and the meditation zones me right out and gets ready for bed. The only thing i wish they had was a calorie tracker(irrelevant if you follow thier meal plan) and a water intake tracker. Maybe some merch too ;) definitely worth the price",5,0,2020-07-03 02:37:32
"This is getting me away from the same old workouts but mostly the same old routines of feeling tired, unhappy, and unfulfilled in this lockdown/quarantine. I'm quietly making my gains everyday and no one needs to see. Once I get back in the boxing gym sparring, and fighting again no one will understand how I maintained my stamina and health. Most of all my mental game is unstoppable and a forceful energy ready to breakdown the next thing that gets in my way. Powerful...",5,0,2020-12-18 05:03:18
"SAVE YOUR MONEY: Downloaded the app and wanted to have a browse. I was keen to take advantage of the 7 day free trial which was fine, but then was charged for the 1 month subscription on the same DAY I downloaded the app. There's no such thing as 7 day free trial on this app 👎",1,12,2021-11-11 02:20:07
"Um... App says 7 day free trial, but after creating an account, it insists on you signing up for a membership before getting to do anything or see if it's worth sending credit card information... The response given confirms this is the practice. Uninstalling. Best of luck. I'm not taking the risk. Thanks anyways.",1,8,2020-03-25 11:47:22
Just joined this app and an trying to view some of the videos and they take ages to load and crash the app. Can't attach the screenshot of the app crash the 2nd time I tried to view a video. Very poor first impression.,2,1,2020-03-28 10:50:05
Great options for exercise at home. Very interesting health articles covering all aspects of health and well-being. A huge catalogue of recipes so you can cook something new everyday and save your favourites for repeat performances. A solid program overall 👍,5,1,2021-04-10 23:09:52
"I'm always been a fan of home workouts and Centr is everything I always wanted. All in one place, yummy and healthy vegan recepies and a bunch or workouts for different levels. Love the blog as I'm always researching about health but information in the internet is overwhelming. In Centr you can find everything in one app and that is just perfect for me.",5,0,2020-06-10 09:04:32
"I subscribed to a 7 day trial, and was charged the full amount (for 3 months) after contacting them I was told that I had previously used a trial but was not told during the sign up process - now my money can't be refunded. Pretty unhappy and frustrated.",1,20,2021-08-02 02:29:14
"Just awesome. {The programs are 6 weeks in duration, and each workout is 32 minutes including warmup, exercise, and cool down.} A very reasonable app for the price of about $100 per year. It has professional trainers, background music, and every type of workout (HIIT, yoga, boxing, cardio, circuit, bodyweight) and also the narrative by Chris is pretty funny!! This is an all-encompassing app for the fitness enthusiast.",5,6,2021-01-24 06:45:39
"Excellent workouts. I've done a few other workout apps that I've really enjoyed but this one goes beyond. The meditations and variety of workouts and the meals, everything is 5 stars. Worth every penny!",5,1,2020-05-13 13:07:24
"The workouts are very interactive and gives you wide range of exercise programs that will suit your needs. Also, meal planning and able to add it to your shopping list is another exiting feature of this app.",5,0,2020-10-07 08:26:25
"A well laid out and designed app. The Centr6 programs are good and the detailed meal and snack recipes are thought provoking and easy to follow. There's a massive variety of coached and self guided routines from MMA to weights, cardio and HIIT. It has it all. Highly recommended.",5,0,2020-06-10 11:29:59
Updated: I have been trying update my subscription and payment options for the app. It won't let me sign in to change that via the app or website. Google Play shows I have no current subscriptions so I can't fix it there.,4,1,2020-05-12 12:36:20
"Has helped me access methods of working out that I felt were previously unavailable to me or were too daunting to try and understand by myself. The instructors are fantastic, the workouts are killer... And the quality of life functions in the app (e.x Guided meditations, sleep visualizations, meal planning, goal planning) make this a truly next level workout companion. Best money I've spent in myself this year.",5,15,2021-09-19 20:56:17
"Signed up for a 7 day free trial, wasn't for me so I've gone to cancel through the app, which can't find my subscription.

"Fantastic! Amazing guided workouts, great meal plans and recipes which even allow for allergies. The well-being and meditation is the best I have seen and really assists with my kids to relax into sleep and create positive mindset for us all especially during this lock down time. Plus I genuinely lose weight through workouts. Big thanks to the teal at Centr!",5,2,2020-08-07 02:54:51
"I loved every second of my experience while working out through this app. The workouts are very well explained with modification (if necessary). I would rate 10/10 for the workouts, also 10/10 for the trainers, last but not least 10/10 for the app.",5,8,2022-01-22 03:18:48
"I honestly never thought I would ever be able to say that an app has changed my life but this app truly has. I always struggled in the past with consistency in my workouts and being in the habit of doing it regularly. With Centr, the workouts are short and effective enough that it doesn't feel like it takes much time out of my day. I've been able to get into a routine of 3-5 workouts every week. I've never felt better! And I love having new delicious, healthy meals to try all the time! WORTH IT!",5,22,2021-07-06 01:20:49
Down 30lbs and strength is up. A set of adjustable dumbbells and bench are the only equipment I have. Started w/ only body weight programs for two months to rebuild base strength and core and then added dumbbells for greater muscle growth. Programs are easy to follow and most show adjustments for lower impact or when you don't have gym-level equipment.,5,0,2022-01-27 14:37:38
"Would like to save my favorite meals. A stretching course would be helpful too, for those of us who haven't tried touching their toes in a while. Would be nice to stream all the workouts to my apple tv or smart tv. Love the meal planning option.",3,0,2020-01-04 16:51:14
"Amazing, Tried other workout apps never liked any of them. Centr really helps with teaching you how do to the workouts, not just telling what you need to do. Also the variety of things Centr offers such as Yoga, the entire nutritional side of the app, MMA/boxing, free weights to free weights. Plus the programs Centr6 and Centr Unleashed really helped me get motivated to actually workout. Best workout app hands down, no questions asked.",5,1,2020-06-05 21:20:56
"I love this application, love the recipes, food is tasty, I would not think of some meals by myself. Exercise is perfect, different every day, you can swap it with you fancy something else.",5,1,2020-07-01 20:15:20
"Awesome, effective workouts! The trainers are excellent, and the variety of work out options keep things interesting. Coaching and training for good form are better than any other program I've used.",5,1,2020-05-14 13:49:13
"Love the 6 week programs for progession and accountability, the mindful aspects and ability to dip in and out with the other aspects of program. Good production though music and exercises can get repetitive (but get there everywhere). Recommended!",5,3,2020-08-28 03:38:29
Best fitness app out there. If you want to take your training to the next level this is the app for you. I always though weight training was the only way to build muscle but this app has shown me that I incorporating multiple facets of fitness along with wellness advice is the real path to a healthy living. Highly recommend,5,1,2021-03-05 21:10:03
"Great app and overall concept. I follow the program daily and have seen massive gains in muscle, fitness, diet and overall wellbeing. I'm enjoying the additional programs that continue to arrive (halfway through centr6 at present) and can't wait for more.",5,1,2020-05-06 10:23:47
Great for beginners. Some workouts are super hard even though listed at 'beginner' but is something to work towards. The 6 week program is great as it shows you techniques thoroughly before starting actual workout. 10/10.,5,0,2020-05-26 07:59:28
"No bugs, great programs, awesome tasty recipes. I've used maybe 20 different exercise apps and this one is the only keeper. Advanced lever is not hard, but still enough if done consistently.",5,1,2020-08-24 10:27:05
Takes the thinking out of diet and workout. The workouts are really challenging but has good tutorials on them. The build muscle option diet is challenging too if you're not much of an eater but can definitely feel and even see the results.,5,1,2020-10-29 12:10:57
"Best Fitness App After only three days of the free trial, I knew I'd be subscribing because the workouts, programs and menus are second to none! Easy to follow program, super motivating. The in-app Planner is well-designed and so practical. I highly recommend!",5,1,2022-05-09 15:33:29
"Best app ever! With all the best dietary choices, the ease of keeping on-top of nutritional intake with every meal you prepare, and the easy shopping list for the weekly planner, why would you go anywhere else. Centre has some of the best food I've cooked and eaten In years. My wife and I have been with centre for 2 years now and would never go back. The workout that Luke, Ashley and Daniel have atm with centre unleashed are fantastic, you'll sweat and you'll love it! Thank you centre ❤️",5,11,2021-01-15 09:04:00
"Re-write. Been using for over a year now and love it. I was never one to follow a program before and just did my own thing...it worked, but this is so much better and well balanced. I love the variety of workouts, styles and trainers ... I never get bored. Keep up the great work team",5,5,2021-11-08 22:02:06
The app really just pushes you to your limits and the personal trainers encourage you every step of the way making it seem more doable. Once you get into the groove of things the workouts are a blast!,5,0,2020-05-24 16:57:18
"Best app for anyone looking to get fit. Meal plans laid out, automatic load over for grocery list of required ingredients. Exercise boot camps and programs are amazing. 11/10! Recommend it to anyone who mentions getting in shape, cooking recipes, and fitness programs for all skill levels.",5,1,2022-08-18 01:33:07
STAY AWAY! THEY ONLY WANT YOUR MONEY! Apparently Im just the latest victim for this scam of a company. I just got a charge on my credit card for the subscription renewal (no email or in app notice whatsoever!) and canceled the subscription and asked for a refund as the charge was still pending. The response I got was cold and financially focused as I was told they absolutely do not issue refunds and quoted their T&C. The $95 fee means more to thier bottom line than my newborn's clothes / food.,1,14,2021-12-02 23:19:19
Very good resource. I would like to see more structured programs like Centr Power Advanced. Also navigating through and selecting workouts is inefficient. Overall I would still recommend it,4,0,2022-02-03 02:29:11
I only use the app as an addition to my group training sessions but I love the trainers and the workouts. The recipes are also a huge bonus and there are heaps of options. I do find them to be a bit carb heavy sometimes though.,4,0,2020-06-04 23:33:38
"Love this app. I like new exercises everyday. The trainers are great and the food choices are wonderful. The only complaint I have would be for Rulk. I find his motivation lacking, its always the same, and his exercise videos always seem to be the same. I skip his days. Other than that I use this app every day.",5,13,2021-05-05 12:36:42
Great training programmes with loads of variety. The meals are excellent and the app has some really nicely thought out features. They seem to be actively listening to the community and adding good usable features.,5,3,2021-06-06 09:11:22
"Great programs- quick and to the point. Makes me sweat and different moves and methods. Meditations are really good, just wish they were longer. Most are 5-10 minutes. Recipes are also great.",5,3,2021-07-09 03:19:35
"Well made, very intuitive and well put together app. Content is great. Did the 6 week free trial (special offer due to Covid-19) and was in no doubt about keeping it going. The trainers that have been pulled together seem to be top of there game and have personality which goes a long way.",5,1,2020-05-09 08:05:06
Absolutely amazing. Everytime I have used it it really makes me work and is always so fun and really makes you feel good about yourself completing each session. Ontop of that the meditation has really helped me during the Lockdown! Thank you guys for such amazing work!,5,0,2020-06-17 17:42:27
"Idk if it's something I'm doing or what but the app will not let me create an account.

"I was soooo excited to finally be able to have access to a gym and recommit to gym due to the sad fact that I now have a fupa. Download this app a few days back but never subscribed, it worked just fine asking for money. I will warn you, the moment I added my subscription I closed the app and drank some water to get myself into ""Cardo mode"". I attempted to open the app and it stated ""Oops we dropped the dumbbell"". This occured for an hour. Only way to unsubscribe is via email. Waste of time app",1,2,2020-05-18 17:24:39
"Didn't want to like it, I like weights and my cycling but I've been using this daily ontop of other fitness and it has kicked my ass. The yoga is a bit too quick for me so I'd maybe try a beginners app first but the rest of the app is top notch. That isn't to say the yoga isn't, in fact it looks amazing I'm just missing changes and would have to watch a few times first before starting it. I'm currently doing the unleashed programme and it is great during lockdow, I'll still use after👍",4,0,2020-05-29 05:23:40
"Amazing app, love the recipes, workouts and sleep visualisations. Completely changed my approach to fitness and have now been training regularly for 4 months with a noticeable difference in how I look and feel. I sleep so much better and generally feel like I've taken real control of my health and wellbeing. Well worth the price",5,1,2020-04-12 15:15:25

"Overall, it's a great app! Some of the workouts use expensive equipment, but there's the option available to switch those out with workouts that use little to no equipment.",5,0,2020-03-27 01:37:06
"Love it! The best thing about the workouts is that when you're done, you've worked your tail off. Afterwards, though, you're not extremely sore and I found myself excited for the days workout instead of dreading it. I like several of the recipes, though I do wish it had more traditional meals.",5,2,2021-02-16 03:39:24
"The App Chris Hemsworth used to become Fat Thor. Summary: Provides coaching and diet content, but it can't tailor it to the user because it doesn't gather essential details like BMI or age. Providing diet and exercise plans without this information is ineffective at best, dangerous at worst. Got as a freebie but forced to pay for a year because of auto renewal. Expensive, and don't reccommed, you can find all the same content in a search engine for free. Insincere developer responses abound too",1,14,2022-11-12 00:49:21
"The workouts feel like they were actually designed for every day people and not just Olympic athletes! I've gotten stronger, more flexible, and more confident in my short 6 months with the program. The trainers are great and the fact that the daily workouts can be anywhere from 14-32 min warm up-cool down almost make you feel silly for skipping! Once I felt stronger and gained confidence I started the 6 week programs and I'm hooked! Diff difficulty levels available. Meal options are awesome too!",5,20,2020-08-18 23:28:42
"I thought this app was free for the first month. That's why I downloaded it in the first place. However after only having it 7 days I have been charged 29.99€. Like many people, I am stuck in quarantine and unable to go to work to earn money. I have 3 kids here and not even had a chance to use this app once before being charged so not happy at all.",1,8,2020-04-15 16:40:41
"I'm the most consistent with exercise I've ever been because of Centr. It gives you a workout to do everyday, with a rest day and a stretch day. The workouts can be done at home with low weight or no weights. It takes out the need to pick a workout from a library of 1000 videos. No guessing what you should be doing on any day.",5,3,2023-03-26 20:25:09

App keeps breaking. Limited communication from the company. Paid for something that doesn't work.,1,3,2023-08-27 20:17:14
"Before the gs closed I loved working out to deal with stress. After I lost focus and stoped working out. I even started having trouble sleeping due to physical inactivity. This got me back on track, I feel good and this helps me get through my workouts. I love how they have modifications for everything too!!",5,5,2021-03-09 03:23:39
"I have tried many fitness apps and programs. Those apps left me feeling frustrated and discouraged. I'm so happy that Centr found me. I was feeling hopeless when it came to my physical health. Centr has sparked the hope inside of me. I love everything inside the app. The coaches, the different styles of workouts, the meal plans, Meditation podcast. I can go on and on. Thank you Chris and Centr Team for creating Centr and helping me develop a healthier body so I can enjoy life with my family. :)",5,5,2019-12-18 17:40:38
** DO NOT DOWNLOAD** Doesn't let me cancel my subscription. They keep saying I could only cancel through my Google account but when I check there is no active subscription. I even contacted Google using the invoice number you guys gave me we still can't find an active subscription. I've been going back & forth for weeks now. This is so unacceptable. I should have never gotten this app.,1,63,2021-11-04 18:08:54
"I attempted to cancel the subscription; when I was notified of a charge to my account anyways, I immediatly notified them and they refused to void the still pending transaction. They will be sure to quote their cancellation policy which will apply even seconds after their new ""subscription period begins."" And even in a global pandemic, they do not care - seems to be a very robotic company.",1,23,2020-05-07 17:24:17

Scam. I have been charged for 3 months despite cancelling my subscription. Customer support have been incredibly unhelpful and claim that my cancellation was not valid because I did it on the app (rather than the website) but the first time I was informed of this was seeing money taken out of my account. I have still not received a refund.,1,7,2022-01-31 09:29:26
"Pros: Plenty of workouts, mindfulness exercises and nutrition options. Shopping list functionality is dope. The fb community is very active and motivational. Cons: How can this advise you on workouts & nutrition to reach your goals if you don't even enter your weight in the app. The guidance appears to basically just select recipes and workouts at random with little to no ""science"" behind it. Why doesn't the daily planner use your current training programs instead random workouts?",3,3,2022-04-06 19:39:16
"When you cancel take a screenshot peeps! Absolutely disgusting customer service! I cancelled my subscription before the end of my trial due to the workouts not being appropriate for me and they have no evidence that I cancelled so I've now got a year subscription that I can't use! Customer service no help, they send me a pic of the emails they supposedly sent but I never got! Yet no evidence of my cancellation go figure!",1,11,2023-02-19 21:29:26
"Horrible!!! I canceled through Google as per instructed and it didn't work! They charged me still. I emailed to cancel and did it again this time on my computer through the website. They are refusing a refund even though i caught it the first day, didn't use it at all and emailed right away!! I'm emailing back to try again and if they fail to refund I'm gonna call my bank and report it as fraud since i canceled and it's their company that messed up.",1,64,2021-05-17 20:43:42
"HI, I downloaded this to try out in lockdown. I've got two torn ACLs so have to be specific about what exercises I do. I would also expect a reminder that the service is about to charge a subscription, nod now they won't return my money. This is theft as I do not want this service. I will be taking this further.",1,8,2020-05-09 14:12:02
"This app is absolutely hands down the best thing to happen to me in 2020. Works out soo much cheaper than the gym and you get a lot more for your money. The Facebook community group is also amazing as we all support each other around the world. From the workouts planner, meal plans, meditation and sleep visualisation, this app has changed my life for the better. Would 100% recommend to anyone. We are all legends and you deserve to feel good about yourself again! 🤗❤️👊💥💪🏻",5,1,2020-07-24 12:17:05
Love this app so much. It takes the decision making and thinking about what workout to do out of the occasion which helps when you are busy and need to build up the habit of working out consistently again. The workouts challenge you more than you would challenge yourself. The instructors are encouraging and you feel like they're actually training you in person. I love it. I am not the type to leave reviews for anything so me writing this much after my killer workout tells you all you need 2 kno,5,17,2021-04-17 15:11:29

"I signed up for the free trial and was still charged after the 7 days even though I cancelled on day 6. I emailed about it and just received a response about how their terms and conditions do not allow 'refunds or credits for unused subscription periods, accidental purchases, medical conditions, or any similar reason or event.' none of which of these were my situation as I am aware that every service has to provide an opportunity to cancel, this basic rule was not followed for me!",1,193,2020-03-07 03:26:28

"LOVE. Meal prep, mental wellness, different workout routines, and a personal planner, plus more. I love the guided coaching on the fitness challenges, and self-guided coaching on my daily workouts. Joining the FB community months later made me wish I discovered it sooner. It's so wholesome! And the team is super responsive to needs. It's really awesome. How do I get a job here? Hahaha.",5,6,2020-04-16 07:52:46
100% agree to all that all the exercises are very well crafted to each and every individual person. My only request is to adjust meal for me. As an Indian i cant get access to most of all this items.So if only that can be done. Totally recommended.👍👍👍,5,0,2022-11-21 15:27:44

It's exactly one month since I started using Centr and I feel absolutely fantastic! The exercises has great results and are so greatly explained I feel no discomfort in my knees and back where I have problems. The recipes are delicious and easy to prepare and gives me the chance to try different cuisines. The team is super sweet and supportive and it's pure pleasure to follow them. I'd say subscribing to Centr really made a huge positive impact on my lifestyle. Thank you!,5,38,2020-09-06 07:39:43
"Really loving the work outs, I'm coming direct from the couch and the beginner 6 week program is the perfect level. I'm sore but not so sure I'm giving up. The recipes are a bit difficult to follow as I only have access to the basics in a country town.",4,1,2021-03-08 19:07:41
"I love the recipes-they are easy to prepare, tasty and fresh and the whole family is enjoying them. The workouts are great too although I would say to start very gently if you are not someone who exercises usually-there is a lot of plyometrics which may be tough on the knees and calves.",4,1,2020-05-12 12:30:31

So much varied and great content for physical and mental health. Really love the recipes too! Really easy to use and follow. Has been so great to keep fit and motivated during isolation.,5,0,2020-05-24 05:12:20
I'm really enjoying this app. Like the structured programmes which are well led by great trainers. I feel motivated to progress through it and after a week I'm already seeing the benefits. Great job putting this together as it is superior to apps I have used before.,5,3,2022-01-06 07:45:42
"This is by far the best home work out app out there. If you are some one new to working out and have no experience or equipment it is fantastic, with workouts all the way to advanced.",5,1,2021-04-22 14:44:48

I really enjoy the 6 week workouts but dont always like the way the coaches workouts are done. E.g. for the warmup theres often no speaking or anything on it (a lot of them) so you just have to watch it the whole time to find out what they doing.,4,2,2020-04-18 04:36:08
Great for working out at home. Workouts are short and intense when you push yourself hard through it. The diary helps you stay on track too which takes the thinking out of what to cook. Well rounded app.,4,0,2020-05-25 02:37:58
Love it. This app can be life changing if you let it. Only gripe is the pace is a little quick I find myself working at a pretty good pace I think but I find myself a rep or two behind sometimes. Other than that this app is amazing!,5,0,2020-06-17 03:44:37
Love the challenge Programs and the daily workouts (these change everyday but you can always access them in case you want to repeat one that you loved). The calming sleep meditations and visualisations are excellent and the recipes are delicious and easy to make.,5,0,2020-05-25 04:17:26

"Excellent fitness app! Food variety is great, workout variety is also great! The only thing it doesn't ask you for you weight, hight and measurements... so it is a little less personal that way and with that maybe we would get more personal macro nutrition. But maybe they will implement this in the future? Otherwise I'm loving this!",4,3,2021-04-10 07:41:37
"It's awesome! I love this app. All the programs on here are so cool and there's something for everyone. Love all the recipes, they are so easy and yummy. And the meditation and sleep visualizations are also great.",5,1,2020-05-04 18:23:52

"Excellent for home workouts with gyms unsafe or closed, or if you prefer at home. Has me sweating and aching, using muscles often missed with the mechanical movements of gym equipment. There is a variety of workouts with different structures and intensities. The meals are incredible as well. Highly recommend.",5,7,2020-11-25 23:30:24
Love the app. I failed the first time doing the 6week free when covid hit but I went back at the end of the year and I have to say I found it easier the 2nd time around. Paid for the year as well now worth the money to keep you healthy.,5,6,2021-03-25 19:38:44
"Fantastic options for exercise, challenging but prevents you from going too hard too fast and going at a steady pace that builds overall body performance - great wellness approach with guides meditations too that have led to some of the best nights sleep I've ever had 👌",5,1,2021-02-05 23:09:49
Unfortunately really disappointing. Nothing here that you can't get on so many free apps already. Just links to videos showing basic workouts and recipes for meals with unrealistic ingredients for the majority of people. Really not worth the price. Just do some online research and experiment with workouts and recipes that suit you.,2,8,2020-04-27 09:22:33
"Pretty good app. Food, workout and meditation in one place. Only downside is that the recepies often have a long ingredient list and prep time and that the subscription fee is on the more expensive side.",4,1,2021-02-17 11:49:57
This is the best at home workout app I've ever used. Love the variety. I'm trying things I wouldn't normal try. I'm fairly beginner in my fitness and I'm finding the planner that's has been put together for me a good level of challenge.,5,0,2021-05-19 23:31:20

So much fun and such variety of workouts with whatever equipment you have. They've got tons of options for whatever goal you have and whatever equipment you've got- tons for if you don't have any weights or equipment either. Super worth the purchase especially right now when gym spaces are limited!,5,1,2021-03-03 03:28:50
"If you're a complete beginner wanted to like exercising then yea try it. Though dont expect to become Chris with this app. Better get you ass of the couch and spend money to your local gym or buy some basic equipment. Circulating same excersises since let's be honest, with no equipment at all you cant do much! Cannot amend the food list, functions not working. Cannot amend your fitness plan either. Not sure what's the apps purpose or target group but Defo not for Intermediate or advanced",1,7,2020-05-30 15:08:49

Great way of having varied workouts and so many meals to choose from to put in your shopping list. A little strange to navigate around the app at first but you soon get used to it!,5,3,2021-11-13 09:16:22
Absolutely love this program!! My savior during this quarantine. I get bored easily and need to change routines daily and this was perfect for that matter. I also did the Unleashed Advanced 6 week program when it came out and loved it. My gym buddy and I have had a lot of fun!!,5,0,2020-08-07 15:14:46
"**UPDATE** So I cancelled the subscription, however renewal date came around and I was charged again, Centr said I didn't actually cancel and would not honor the cancellation. Now as I try to login and try and get some use out of the service they are trying to charge me again (even though the service is paid for for a whole year). So first the don't honor my cancelation and blame me for not canceling when I actually did, now they lock me out of the account after my account has been paid for.",1,5,2022-05-05 16:53:24

"Awesome. For an at home workout, it's enjoyable enough to motivate you to want to do the next class tomorrow. I am doing begginner unleashed and it's not too exhausting to ruin your work day, but sufficient to make your muscles feel like they have been used. Especially when you are sitting at your work desk, it makes you realise that you had better exercise again tomorrow, because otherwise sitting will be the extent of your fitness.",5,1,2021-05-29 00:58:41
I hate doing this cuz it's my boy Thor...but it is super un cool that the refund policy is trash ....Doing this at a real gym is illegal but because it's an app it's OK. I called the day of the auto renewal to cancel and they were unwilling to offer a refund and I see this happened to a lot of people in the reviews..Perhaps take this feedback into consideration.... Not cool in a pandemic. Especially on the day of the transaction which I now wear for a year just un cool.,1,5,2021-04-28 10:40:56

"Great for works outs. But the UI for adding weights in the log book is terrible. You can't type in 150lbs you have to spin some scrolling wheel from 0 to 150. That's just asinine. Oh and this is great, how the heck do you edit a workout? Maybe ask before you automatically finish a workout. Come on people. What is this amature hour?",3,4,2021-08-19 22:47:53

"It really is a fantastic program. I love the way it blends nutrition, exercise, and mental health into one seamless app. There are so many varieties of work outs and exercise from Yoga to MMA. It has had a built in community which support each other. Could not recommend this higher, 6 out of 5 stars.",5,2,2020-05-09 20:39:52
Going well now but took me a bit to get started. I don't typically have the ingredients for much of the recipes so that had me at a slow start. Also eating healthy seems to cost more too. I'm starting to use more and benefits the family too so we are all eating better foods.,5,0,2023-01-26 16:36:30

Please let me know. 🤟🏻",5,12,2020-12-26 06:46:52
"There is nothing in the app you can't learn for cheaper elsewhere. Subscription trap. Have to go through 3 pages to unsubscribe, or you will be surprised with a bill a year later.

Would love to see you guys prove me wrong and do the right thing but I'm not optimistic.",1,2,2023-02-28 05:11:21

Why are you trying to charge me when I canceled my subscription weeks ago? EDIT 2/22: I did cancel my subscription within the time constraints specified. Far before the time specified in fact. I really believe it's bad business to try to discredit a customer with an issue they reached out for help for on a public platform. I wouldn't be complaining here if I had received a timely response from your email team. What else do you want to justify or try to place blame for before you help me ?,1,5,2021-02-23 03:43:17

"Can't even use the app without going past a paywall, they should make it free to use for everyone with no ads so people can decide whether or not they find value in the app then opt for the premium version if they like it, not forcing people straight away to pay for a free trial and having to opt out as no one wants to be giving out credit card details to an app they just downloaded, a better option would be madbarz workout app.",1,1,2022-12-30 18:16:16
I have used this app for 2 years. I can't live one day without this app. It has a lot of variety on workout and i think that's the main reason i can persist my workout routine for this long.

I have two minor comments I wish there were videos on how to get technique right i.e. how to actually do a press up correctly. And I wish the Cente6 workouts were more varied from week to week but I'm loving it, I feel strong and I can see myself getting stronger week on week. This app will change your life!",5,1,2020-04-28 01:16:57

"Love the workouts, daily planner and 6 week programs. You can set your own goals such as losing weight, getting fit or building muscles, switch and do more trainings, and listen to the friendly banter. I cannot get the ingredients, but the meals look yummy while helping you with your goals, and for those with time, you can do the mindfulness too. It helped me plan my workouts during the long lockdown, and acts as a personal training to keep me disciplined to do my daily workout.",5,3,2020-07-19 16:18:29
"Bought this app to help me exercise from home.

Warning - don't get annual subscription as its very repeititive content - you don't get anything else out of it after 3 weeks. Have had multiple exchanges with customer service & they will not refund $120 for automatic renewal of my annual subscription that I cancelled months ago. Really disappointing experience actually & not what I signed up for. Turns out the only thing Centr are good at is marketing.,1,6,2022-08-15 11:47:43
"An at-home option that tailors to both the enthusiast and novice alike, the app is a huge credit to Chris and his team's expertise in terms of fitness, wellness and nutrition.

"Took a bit to get oriented where everything was. I don't follow the structured plan they lay out, but there's so many exercises/recipes to mix and match it's well worth it",5,0,2020-07-25 01:40:29
Just like Chris Hemsworth this app is legendary! I've been using this for about 5 months now and have seen amazing results. The programs are fun and very intense. There's ton to choose from and plenty of healthy recipes to keep you feeling energetic and ready for every day's workout!!,5,1,2021-08-24 22:07:49
This app is very good. The coaches explain step by step everything to do. They teach you in 3 different ways. so it's good to know my level of each exercise. I will definitely invest again in this membership. Love it and believe me this works.,5,1,2020-04-25 21:46:42

"This app is garbage!!!! I tried to cancel my subscription and I couldn't find the way to do it! I'm not an idiot, I have many subscription services and this is by far the most hard and complicated of them!!! They literally steal your money. This sucks, my wife is a lawyer, we just started the papers to sue them, I know is a small amount of money but it's a fraud. Don't get this app.",1,3,2020-05-18 03:34:40

"Great app, great workouts. If you're just starting on beginner go though the trainer's and find one that best suits your level of fitness not all trainer's have the same workouts so take your time. Worth a try and stick with it!",5,1,2021-02-22 09:11:59
Overall amazing experience so far three and a half months in! Love the variety of workouts and started adapting some of the things I've learned into some of my own daily routines.,4,1,2020-04-06 16:03:52
"Thsi app is amazing, i have been following the workouts and meal plan for months now and i really get a lot out of it! Though i have two sugestions 1. Would be to have a family subscription option. 2.

Been using for just under a year and it's taken our family by storm. Everyone gets involved even the kids which is great.

"I've only had the app a couple weeks but I'm really enjoying it. The workouts are great, even for a beginner like me. The only thing I would like to see added is the ability to cast the workouts to a TV, especially during this C19 lockdown.",4,1,2020-04-17 11:32:03

It is a great app that allows you to pick your meals and workouts. It also contains workouts with modifications so with little to no equipment you can still workout.,4,0,2020-08-03 11:11:17
"Its actually perfect, covers PT, diet and what to buy for the weekly shop all in one. The workouts are really tough and iv been going to the gym for 4-5 years (on and off) and there's so many excercises I've never seen or done before. Having to pay the $110 for the year pissed me off but now its pretty much working as a motivator to get the most out of the app and now its paying off. Awesome job Centr really appreciate it, made Melbourne lockdown a little easier.",5,24,2021-09-30 07:28:12

"I initially subscribed to this app for the workouts but I'm remaining subscribed for the meal planner. This app makes planning, shopping for, and cooking a healthy diet a breeze.

"Terrible customer service. Their website FAQ says they will reply within 24 hrs. Expect a week. I forgot to turn off auto renew because I was busy getting laid off from my job and trying to survive through a pandemic. When I implored them to help, they said too bad I should have read the terms and conditions. So, don't expect kindness from this company.

"Having the hardest time getting my refund, Centr customer service keeps saying Google play bad to process it when it is the developers responsibility to do so, all they have done is pass the ball and not take responsibility to process the refund. I love the app but since they were offering the 6 week free trial 2 days after I signed up I figured they would be good and let me cancel whilst all this crazy pandemic is going on.

"Enjoy no longer having knees or a lower back if you're over 250lbs and older than 35. This did more harm than good. The warm up and cool down exercises are quite arbitrary and do little for preparing and cooling down the muscles worked. Incredibly leg heavy. The personal trainers are too chippy and come off as disingenuous. If you're already young and healthy, this will probably propel you further in your fitness goals. If your like me, start somewhere else like the aerobics room.",3,1,2022-09-02 22:41:18

"It has been solid so far. I'm just completing one of the programs now. I appreciate the self guided version that allows me to take it to the gym and do my workouts. It allowed me to build up to the exercises in the coming weeks, getting me stronger and ready while not burning me out.

"This is a fantastic app! It's a full package that I haven't come across before: workouts tailored to your goals and fitness level + meals tailored to your diet. I absolutely love the trainers and the sessions, but what sold me on Centr and not the competitors was the food. I've always struggled with pairing the workouts and diet. Centr makes is stupidly simple, at least for me. My only, and I do mean only grapple with Centr is the fact that it doesn't come with any progress trackers. While this is certainly not a deal killer, it would be nice to have a place to drop in your daily weight or waist size to see the progress. Again, there are other apps that do that so it's not big deal. Perhaps one day Centr will produce an update with such features?? In the meantime get this app now. I said NOW!!",5,51,2021-03-08 03:16:06
"Been a Centr member from day 1 (Feb 2019). Used many different workout apps/programs but this is by far the best. Excellent customer service, bunch of trainers and experts who always engage and interact with the community and of course, the community itself.

1000000 times better than a gym membership. I have just started the Centr 6 training program and have been following the vegan meal plan with a cheat meal once every 3 weeks. The weight has melted off me and I'm starting to see huge differences in my physical appearance in terms of body tone. Personally in terms of health and fitness I'm in the best shape I have ever been in. Absolutely zero regrets! Love this app,5,1,2020-07-18 14:40:05
Love this app. The exercise program has changed my life and my home workouts. The meals and recipes are delicious . The meditations and the kids sleep meditation worked a treat for my 4 year old. The Centr Community is very supportive also. I started 6 weeks ago just as lockdown started in the UK and my gym closed. This has really helped me achieve some great results from home.,5,1,2020-05-13 16:58:55

Perfect if you have a gym next door or some material at home. It would be greate if we could have more workouts with no equipment (not only just cardio but some arms/chest workout wouldbe great !). For none English speakers it would also be cool if the recipies would be written in different languages.,5,3,2021-10-28 18:33:49
"7 days to start seeing results! Within the trial period alone I started seeing more definition in my upper body. The meal plan is what sets this one apart from many others like it.

I'm starting on a wonderful journey, and I think this is the best to reach my goals before the of my subscription.",5,13,2020-09-01 00:06:47
The app isn't working! It always says 'Network connection lost.' Please fix this issue right away! The programs are great but I need to be able to access it through the app on my phone. I don't want to use the browser.,1,1,2020-06-23 02:02:17
"You get it all in one app! Workouts, nutrition, meditation and best of all a great, supportive community online. The first fitness avenue that has had me enjoying and wanting to work out, even when I'm on my own at home. I've also found it so much cheaper than the monthly cost of a gym, which is an added bonus.",5,2,2020-08-24 04:42:06
Amazing app! Been using it since more than a year and I have not been disappointed once. The coaches are great and there are many different workouts. Some require equipment and others don't. Thank you,5,1,2021-05-23 19:25:41
"The app is improving. It would be great to have the chance to use it offline as well, even when showing only the images it uses almost 1gb per session.",4,35,2020-03-18 13:46:21
"The recipes and meditations are great, but the yoga videos are a little hard to keep up with. If there was any way to make them easier to follow that'd be great. Maybe diagrams or more yin yoga tutorials, just for those who like to take it slow with yoga!",4,1,2020-04-08 14:59:32
"I've been enjoying this app for a few months now, and after the introduction of Centr Power am liking it even more! Great, easy to follow workouts, some delicious recipe ideas and I might never have gotten round to given meditation a try if it wasn't for this app, so for me it's been excellent.",5,5,2021-07-17 05:51:03

"This app is nice but the auto-renew feature and refund policy are pretty poor. I don't have time to use the app this year and forgot to cancel before the auto renewal. The company refused to refund the cancelation even though the purchase was made the same day. Basically, I'm stuck paying $120.00 for an app I won't use.",1,5,2021-01-29 03:56:52
The workouts are clear and easy to follow. I love Tabata style with the built-in timer on screen. The little preview of the upcoming exercise also is sooo nice. Great job guys!,5,0,2020-05-23 23:07:55

"Love the workouts, but sometimes they only do one side so I pause and do other side. Meals, slowly getting head into it, like it that they are achievable groceries and cooking times.",4,1,2020-05-12 21:39:01
The fitness apps so far...i never be consistent in workout until i found centr..it help me more fit and consistent doing workout. Meal plan is great and we can swap the menu also..best apps..it would be more better if can connect with fitness watch like fitbit to track calori. Keep good work teams !!,5,1,2020-06-21 02:21:33

"DO NOT TRUST! Even if you cancel they don't register it and keep charging. All positive reviews are days apart and same wording, clearly paid staff and others to push down all the negative reviews! They keep charging you after you cancel in the app, then try to say you're ""changing your mind"" (vs them scamming). Response below implies I didn't cancel, but the entiure issue is they don't register the cancellation...this scam made the news in Australia but they won't acknowledge this or action. Emailing as suggested below is ineffective and they'll just gaslight you.",1,85,2021-07-01 04:45:57
"I love it! Don't know if these exercises truly contribute to muscle gains, even when selecting the appropriate weights, but I freakin love the recipes, just wish the ingredients themselves were not so hard to find, stuff like dukkah and fennel bulb and specialty stuff like that, but overall fantastic!",4,3,2020-10-06 03:41:13

"Worse custumer service Dont doit is my advice , I pay for this app a year ago I use the app 4 time maybe 5 time. The app is no for me. I did everything on the website I clock the bottom of inactive this year I got charge 95.99 again. When I send email they say I don't read the contract.Yeah I deactivate a year ago and u still changing with out any email notification. Your company is a vampire and give 0 on rate I don't have that option.",1,18,2021-02-20 15:24:14
"Already after 8 weeks seeing noticeable gains. Great app all the way around! Love the attention to lifting, nutrition, personal wellness and ""Rulking"" Totally worth just having someone tell you you're a legend! The personal wellness is great for refocusing your attention on what's good in this life. And I would pay for the app just to hear Chris do his 2-3 minute meditations on life!! Totally worth it! Kevin",5,2,2021-01-30 00:06:23
"Love this app and have been using it since 2020, but last two days I can't cast to my Samsung tv with Google Chrome cast. My OS is good, anc my tv is a snart tv. The app allows me to cast but won't connect. All other streaming apps let me cast as usual.",3,2,2023-04-16 02:05:07
"The life coach of apps. When you wake up centr is there to guide you through a balanced day in most areas, fitness, diet, meditation, you name it.

I was a normal skinny kid and is now looking like a total beast compared to before. I'm the strongest guy in my class as I am typing this. Most of the meals are great and healthy in my opinion, and I love how you can plan everything.",5,0,2022-05-27 05:14:25

"No REAL free trial. It says free trial, but takes you to the subscription page. That's not correct. I'm glad I didn't subscribe and uninstalled the app. Cause later read reviews of people being charged on day 1 itself. In the name of marketing and ""policy"" this is cheating. If the app is really good and is suppose to help people with their health goals then a REAL free trial and not bounded by subscription should decide itself. If the app is good ppl will stay.",1,4,2022-08-02 11:11:03

"Really good (HARD) workout! I wish the instructors would add some new things from time to time because it gets repetitive, but it is definitely making me fit.",4,0,2020-05-18 00:51:26
With this app you get a full wellness experience. You don't have to plan ahead for workouts. The recipes are really tasty. They even have mental wellness with meditations They post helpful blogs so you feel part of a community. This has been a staple app since the gym has been closed.,5,1,2020-08-06 13:11:35
Great motivational fun workouts! Instructors are having a good time while kicking your butt. Nice food options with easy recipes for healthy meals. Great way to maintain your fitness goals.,5,0,2021-02-16 03:11:39
Too many clicks to adjust workouts on the fly. It can interrupt the flow of my workout. Some of the features can be hard to find if I need to modify something.,4,2,2021-07-03 01:44:51
"Love the app, only suggestion would be to allow for downloadable workouts (even if available for 24-48hr periods after loading) for those on the go or traveling with limited access to wifi sometimes. Program is great otherwise.",4,4,2020-02-04 08:07:09

"This app changed my life. I have gone from someone who forced herself to go to the gym 3 times a week yet not feeling like anything was done, to a girl who misses the gym on rest day and loves to go 5-6 times a week and every single time feeling stronger than yesterday. I have a saying, ""sore today, strong tomorrow"". This app will make you feel it and see it. From workouts to delicious food, this app has it all, and to top it all they have a wonderful FB community worth checking out!!!",5,0,2020-02-14 13:35:30
Great workouts. One thing I'd change is the planned meals. The ingredients vary too much within the day or the week. It's really hard to keep up with. Yes you can swap meals but what's the point of the planner then?,4,12,2020-11-20 23:23:21
Great option for do it yourself motivators. Great workouts that get your heart rate up and the coaches keep you going ***Updated*** still 5 stars because the workouts are great but I would like a way to adjust the workouts so that it starts my week on Saturday instead of Monday. I play soccer Wednesday and Friday evenings and use Thursday for my rest day but i can't set the weekly agenda to do that so I either have to swap the workouts out or just scroll through the days.,5,0,2022-09-10 12:15:41
"I got billed for the app even though I was in the trial period. I tried telling customer service that I would like to have a free trial, was refused saying I had installed the app earlier. Even asked them to check if I had used the app, I'm sure they have logs to check that. But won't. That said, the app is quite good. If only you could fix your onboarding flow.",1,12,2021-05-07 14:54:39
"When I started using this app it was a last resort for me, I was trying to put on muscle for over a year with no results, eating nothing but chicken rice and egg but started using this app and the meals are incredible I'm barely having cheat days anymore because there just isn't any point and I've gained 2 stone of lean mass so far, would definitely recommend",5,3,2021-03-10 17:08:04

I downloaded this app based off some really good reviews and I have to say it's really good I'm only doing the workout section of this at the moment but I'm only on week 2 of. The centr 6 program and I am starting to see some significant muscle gains as well ass some major fat loss. I definitely recommend this app.,5,0,2020-07-16 12:04:20
Was skeptical at first but love this app! A friend suggested the meal plan can be take it or leave it and I've not bothered but I love love love the trainers and the variety of workouts available. I expect I'll be using this for years to come!,5,0,2022-06-16 10:12:34

Love the workouts but honestly if you want food and workout this ap is super unhealthy I looked at one of my day full of eating and it totalled 1036 calories this isn't even the bare minimum a woman should be eating it's an eating disorder waiting to happen. This should be fixed massively as it's honestly very messed up!,3,3,2023-04-18 13:08:34
"This app is the best exercise app I've ever used! With price points at less than most gym memberships, you get guided workouts and a meal plan. The guided workouts also come with short video tutorials on how to do the workout and offers low impact alternatives. Furthermore, the app encourages you to go at your own pace and do what is comfortable. I've recommended this to friends who are turned off by gym membership and personal trainer prices who still desire a more structured workout regimen",5,12,2021-08-02 19:40:12
Great workouts. Had been doing bootcamp for years but this is as good. Love the programs as it makes me commit to daily workouts and I tend to do beginners through to advance so sorts out months of exercise routine. when I run out I look at the individual exercises or I guess I and start again as been over a year since I started the first program of centre 6. Lots of options including weights etc to do and saves alot of travelling time when I can do it at home. Great value for a year!!,5,0,2023-02-03 02:25:54
Excellent way to build good nutrition and fitness all levels. Two suggestions. It would be great to have a way of finding beginner workouts for Cardo Monday strength Wendesday and stretch Friday. Also more vegetables in meals would be great for those on low carb plans.,4,0,2021-01-24 22:28:51
Cannot recommend this app enough! From providing endless recipes and workouts and having seamless operation it's perfect. Perfect for learning new things and keeping on top of your grind. Worth every penny!,5,1,2020-05-12 22:00:22
This is a great app for coached workouts and it also has lots of recipe ideas for any dietary requirements. It is best used alongside a calorie tracking app like my fitness pal. This has been one of my top purchases of the year for health.,5,0,2020-10-07 08:00:34
Fantastic app. Been sticking to the workouts for a month now and seeing progress. If I start using the diet plan as well I'm sure my results would be huge. But meditations are great and a quick way to get my mind right,5,0,2022-02-02 23:41:57

"Second time writing this review, as it appears as though my initial review was removed. Upon downloading the Centr app, it stated that I would receive a 7 day free trial, but it also made you select a subscription that would apply after those 7 days. I was immediately charged the full year subscription price when I signed up for the trial, and Centr support refuses to refund me because someone with the same name has used the free trial before. Stay away if you have a common name.",1,24,2022-01-25 16:51:28

Brilliant app! Really saw some fantastic results from it! I 110% recommend it for anyone of any age! And shame on everyone dragging Chris' name through the mud because they forgot to cancel after the free subscription. It's not an apps responsibility to remind you to unsubscribe. Take some responsibility!!,5,1,2020-05-17 07:02:33
The programs are all around 30 minutes with minimum equipment. Perfect for building up fitness habit into a busy life style. Loving it so far!!,5,6,2020-10-03 10:09:40

Centr itself is great. If I were rating Centr this would be a 5 star review. However I'm rating the app. The app doesn't have screen casting functionality for the workout videos. The web browser version of Centr does. This is a fatal flaw. Uninstalling until this is rectified. Update: thank you for updating the app to support chromecast. Here's your 5 stars!,5,6,2020-02-17 03:11:03
"I've been doing this program for about 2 months now. I'm currently in some of the best shape of my life. The food, workouts, and experience is unbelievable. It makes you want to show up everyday. They let you choose from hundreds of meals and workouts. Take it from someone who's done Bodybuilding, calisthenics, powerlifting and the infamous Athletics X. This is the ultimate workout program for balance and longevity. Amazing work centr keep it up. This program is made for anywhere and anytime.",5,1,2022-01-17 03:12:00

Shouldn't even be described as a fitness app because it is just so much more! It is hands down the best one I have ever used and find it hard to imagine any other fitness app even coming close. This is NEXT LEVEL! Cannot recommend enough!,5,1,2020-04-02 15:37:37
"Had a free 12 month trial, during which I cancelled my subscription as I didn't think it was going to be worth the price to renew it when the time came. When that time came, Centr attempted to charge me for a 1 year membership anyway. Luckily, the card was no longer active and they couldn't.",1,6,2022-09-23 06:35:15
"So far this looks like a great app with yum food and strong workouts. You will need to have some basic equipment or find a substitute.

I will email you lovely team, because I can't figure out how to do it, soz newb on Google pixel/ laptop x",5,5,2020-03-25 11:49:27

Finally an app with modifications that apply to the equipment I have at home. It's always with gym machines or no weights. I have some stuff at home but had trouble finding an app that would do a mix. Ive been at this for 2 weeks now and I'm loving every day.,5,1,2021-05-25 00:10:12

Plan includes workouts, delicious meals/snacks & mental health plus bonus articles on health & wellness. Swap out workouts or meals anytime & still be on the plan.

Just hit 40 and basically haven't done anything physical apart from farming for 13 years since retiring from rugby. To workout with a professional at my time and place is great. The meal planner, yoga, pilates, meditation are all a bonus. A suggestion though, is to link shopping list with Coles or Woolies, surely Chris knows Curtis? Make it happen.",5,2,2021-02-27 22:35:54

"In October I began my fitness journey because I needed a lifestyle change for heal purposes. I'm a huge Marvel fan so I was drawn to Centr because of Chris Hemsworth's attachment to it. While Chris doesn't have much to do in the actual app the other trainers have kept me engaged in particular Luke, Ashley, and Rulk. I've tried other apps and program in the past and lost interest very quickly. Great techniques for beginners and awesome meal planning features. 1000% recommend Centr to everyone.",5,3,2021-12-10 23:58:41

And their policy is horrendous. They're just here to scam you out your money. Customer service was terrible if you're trying to get a refund they won't give you your money back at all cost and I think thats unfair because my hard earn was STOLEN from me. Says alot about a company who only want your money.,1,5,2022-07-29 21:23:19
"I have loved using this app! Each day you get a new workout and it provides a good variety (hiit, strength, mma, boxing, Pilates and yoga). The recipes are delicious and can even just provide you with inspiration for some new meals to cook. The app works great and there are no ads. 10/10",5,1,2020-04-27 21:47:28
"Um, app no longer let's you in 'AT ALL', until you pick one of the subscription options, classy. No thanks, as long as that stays, the app will be immediately closed. Update: Ah, reading comprehension fail by centr support, it seems.",1,15,2021-05-12 09:21:02
"I use Centr supplementally but the meal planning and making grocery lists for you makes it so easy if you want to be hands off for the week and want a regimen to follow. Overall, love how the app is focused on overall wellness, not just ""Get swole like Thor"" or somethin. Best overall fitness app I've used.",5,0,2022-11-27 16:28:57
"A great variety of trainers and programs to expose the user to new methods and modalities. User friendly, easy to follow, short and sharp (& effective) workouts & nutritious and delicious meal options. I also love the importance that's placed on mental wellbeing and a holistic approach to health (I.e. meditation & sleep hygiene). 10/10",5,4,2020-12-01 09:21:58
"App should allow downloading of the training beforehand . Sometimes, half the time is over by the time the video starts playing . Training also doesn't seem to customize for the person . An intermediate training by xx trainer can be super difficult vs another intermediate training by yy trainer . Not the best training but a good lifestyle app App should also allow a slow mo video pre exercise . Pardon my low intelligence, Some of the exercises are a little complex (eg hulk sequences)",2,2,2020-06-14 10:03:03
Great app with some awesome training programmes and food/snack choices. Can't wait to see some results after a few months. (Remember what ever your goal is - adjust your calories) :),5,3,2022-01-20 13:32:05
It has does exactly what I hope it would have done. Challenge me and let enjoy everything it has to offer. Programs and training are great. The food recipes are amazing. The best bang for buck I have ever spent.,5,3,2021-11-13 08:15:30
"It may discourage you in using this app with the higher cost, but trust me, it is worth it! I went from not working out at all to working out 6 days a week in just 2 weeks, and I'm about a month in and have already felt a major strength difference. Trust me, this is way better than any gym membership or those workout YouTube videos.",5,0,2021-02-17 15:04:18

"A wonderful, well structured app with a myriad of resources for your physical and mental health. The app also has a functional and varied meal plan available to users, with new recipes being added regularly and Mondays reserved as as a vegetarian day. Worth the money in my opinion and I would recommend.",5,15,2021-12-03 21:39:44
This app hasn't worked at all except for the first day I tried to use it I'm on the first free 6-week trial and I'm not getting anything for free it's just a big huge bug issue where it doesn't want to go on when I try to open it up it just loads and says please try again so here's the deal when 6 weeks is over if I haven't gotten the chance to use anything I'm getting ahold of my bank to dispute the charges otherwise you start this all over again for me and you make sure that the app works,1,6,2021-01-11 20:54:34
"I'm gonna be honest, I was totally wrong when I thought this was all hype. It's an incredible app and program and blows all the others I've tried out of the water. It works well, adapts to me, gives me what I want, when and how I want it, and the workouts are perfect for me. I say try three months like I did, then get the whole year like I'm about to.",5,4,2021-05-03 03:31:25
"I am doing the 6 week program, it's a good workout to do every day but throughout the 6 weeks the exercises don't change week to week. A bit more variety in the program would be good. The 6 days of workouts have just been an extra added into my PT sessions.",4,1,2020-04-07 04:34:23
"The app has been awesome for home body weight workouts. I've used it with weights every now and then too, it's great for shaking things up. I'm seeing/feeling results 2/6 weeks into one program, good stuff!",5,1,2021-05-19 21:30:50
The recipe list is really nice. The workout log is sort of clunky. A variety of exercises and meditation concepts. A solid appt for the annual price. I recommend 👌,4,0,2023-01-01 16:59:44
"After installation you have to create an account. Ok fine, once account is created you have to pay before even going to the next screen. You don't have an option to see what's inside and if its something that you are looking for. Nope you have to pay before anything. There is no skip button. I'm uninstalling.",1,2,2022-05-13 07:09:31
Amazing. Love the food and workouts. However it would be nice to have some more variety in the workouts. After having the app for 6 weeks it seems like I've gone through the majority of the workouts. Even though the workouts are amazing it would be nice to have a little more,5,2,2021-02-24 18:32:51
"Love the workouts. Wish there was a way to mute JUST the music and play my own... That's my only gripe. OH that and I wish there were more notifications like ""it's time for your daily workout!"" And being able to schedule my workout and put them on my calendar...",4,1,2021-03-07 18:22:43

Love this app. Always has the right level of workout in the format I need.,5,0,2023-06-19 16:52:41
Pretty much just use it for the workouts. I've used tons of workout apps and the self guided workouts here are the best in my experience. Great mix and great functionality during the workout. Highly recommend,5,1,2021-03-28 19:13:39
"Could use captions and perhaps a breakdown of how to do some of the yoga and Pilates poses like they do for some of the excercises. Otherwise fantastic! Keeping me ingaed which, with ADHD is quite impressive!",4,0,2022-11-09 12:00:10
"Nice app. Started using when gym shut down due to Covid. Took me a couple weeks to find my groove, but now thinking I'm not needing a fancy gym anymore. Hopefully in future updates they let you pick out and plan your own weekly workouts with the planner. It would be great to be able to plan a weeks worth of workouts knowing what else you have on during the week so you can plan ahead. Cheers Team",4,1,2020-04-26 08:24:59
"Tremendous app. I have never lifted weights before and started on the power program and after five weeks I gained muscle, I feel stronger, and I'm not sore. Hugely, in part, due to the recipes in the app. I was surprised at how beginner friendly it is.",5,0,2022-06-06 00:36:05
Really enjoying so far. The exercises are good for my level while still being challenging and heaps of great recipes which substitute healthier ingredients into favorite meals without making it so different you hate it,5,0,2021-12-06 06:43:27

Everything in one app. The price is worth it. 2 suggestion: One is to add the meal plans with the coached program workouts. 2nd is to Have the ablility on the planner side to swap out workouts with the program workouts ex: unleashed , phase2 or Masterclass. Get the App!! A must Have!",5,3,2020-11-10 20:26:41
"A bit pricy for me, but seems to be the first program that's actually sticking for me! We'll see how long I can keep this in my budget for. A little widget for my home screen would be a nice add.",4,4,2023-03-31 20:07:13
It's not just a workout app it's a lifestyle app. The workouts are easy to follow and self paced which works good for me as I have a home gym set up and my favorite is the weekly shopping list for the meals so you don't forget anything,5,0,2021-08-14 06:08:44
Great workouts and the programs are really well designed. Intermediate is right at my level. I don't ever really get into the food or meditation. I totally should.,5,0,2020-09-29 04:20:05

"I am no stranger to running until I feel like I'm going to pass out. Couple a knee injury and covid, I haven't been at it like I used to. I would lift some weights we bought and do physical therapy workouts for my knee but needed more. Tried this app and was impressed with how much it kicked my butt. I am now a paid subscriber.

"I've enjoyed using Centr Fit. On week 3 of Centr 6 phase 1. I've struggled with recurring neck and back injuries over the last few years where the flare ups would occur so often it seemed like I wasn't going to be able to make any progress to feel healthy and fit again. A buddy brought this up to me and I jumped in. Any system works if you work it, and so far I feel the improvements and feel better. Btw, 2 weeks was my previous max of consistent training before an injury would occur.",4,6,2021-04-15 02:38:39

"Wanted to try the app when I heard it was free during the epidemic... Just got charged $135 for something I used once and decided wasn't for me. Update - I appreciate the developer reaching out and advising me to contact their e-mail. I did and received one back. Was told their small print covered their end so I’m out a years subscription fee for a simple mistake. They apologized and were truly sorry but can’t even make an attempt to meet me in the middle and help out someone during these tough economic times. I suggested just charging me a months fee and refunding me the rest but haven’t heard anything from them since. Feeling like I was taken advantage of by a service that promotes a good, healthy lifestyle. Beware of this organization. You’re just cash in the bank, they seem to not really care about people at all.",1,14,2020-05-08 21:42:49
I'm enjoying the planner exercises. I don't have to figure it out on my own. Wish the exercises could be downloaded for offline use when my reception is bad. Some of the meditations are really on point lol.,4,1,2023-03-13 05:22:30
Exactly what everyone needs. This app provides flexibility in all workouts for your skill level. The new release of workouts is benchmark. We have consistently got up every weekday morning to do these workouts before the kids get up and love starting our day with Centr. The trainers are engaging and they make it fun. And value for money... there is no comparison. Love it.,5,8,2022-02-02 00:21:53

Their intermediate program is fantastic. It has me sweating and cursing by the end of it and I love it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I wish it was just a flat one time fee rather then a recurring fee.,4,1,2020-12-28 16:00:08
"The app, workouts, and recipes are ok, but the customer service is terrible. I tried to cancel service and it didn't confirm. After being charged for another year of service, they would not issue any refund. They only want your money and don't care about the user. Many other people have had this issue.",1,0,2023-01-02 20:56:58
Cancelled trial subscription after 24 hours but still they took money out. Contacted customer services who told me I must have not cancelled but I did. They then just accused play store instead. Judging by other comments its a common scam they are running and have no intentions of helping you resolve it or refund you. Very frustrating customer services.,1,8,2022-03-11 07:02:05

There are also mindfulness meditation and ones for good sleep called sleep visualizations,. I love how Centr sends me emails that are nourishment for my wellbeing, like how to get out of a toxic relationship. I can't recall the exact title. Some emails link to podcasts too.

I love this app. I never really stuck to a workout schedule before and fluctuated heavily in weight until I found this app. I've managed to convince myself to workout daily and feel much better with myself.,5,0,2020-08-09 10:08:07
"I didn't really care for the app so I cancelled my 7 day trial... 100% positive I cancelled and uninstalled the app. Non-stop notifications was the main reason, but just looked at my bank account and have been being charged $32 bucks per month for an app I don't even have.",1,3,2021-05-07 15:28:26
"3 weeks into the Power program and I'm loving it so far. I thought I'd have an issue with working out 6 days a week but the program is designed to have active rest days from lifting and, on these days, get a vigorous workout from doing bodyweight circuits. Centr is more than just workouts. There are meditations, articles, and recipes to help you get the calories you need. As a vegan, I was pleasantly surprised with the hundreds of recipes they make available. So far I cannot complain!",5,15,2021-12-28 19:41:07
"This program is amazing. If you are looking for structure, guidance and a full meal plans, this is for you! The meals are delicious- Clean eating with bursting flavors! Tons of variety in workouts with everything from Pilates and yoga to Hiit and Boxing then you can wind down with calming meditation. This app has a little bit of everything for everyone. Wish I started sooner!",5,0,2020-09-10 12:21:45
"Amazing, however it would be nice if the recipes were more student/budget friendly.. as we don't all have time or money to go grocery shopping multiple times a week.",4,0,2020-11-13 22:35:27
Well organised app. Keep up the good work!,4,0,2023-08-06 23:17:13
Centr is the only workout program I have stuck to and thanks to the team I have lost and kept off 25kg. The variety of the exercises and programs for me is key as well as the meditations. And I've done it all from my home gym. I cannot recommend centr enough. I seriously tell everyone about it,5,0,2022-07-08 22:23:19
"Really glad I checked the reviews before signing up for something that they apparently just copy pasted some basic workout routines from online & then make sure there's no way for you to get your money back if you forget to cancel after the free week. Really disappointed that Chris would attach his name to such a poorly thought out cashgrab. Seriously dude, you're so much better than this. Thanks so much for the copy pasted reply bot, you definitely convinced me you're not moneyhungry sleezebags",1,6,2021-02-14 03:18:53
I L-O-V-E this app! There is so much selection for workouts but also recipes and guided meditation. I have almost completed Centre Unleashed for 6 weeks and I have never been this motivated to continuously work out. The online community is also amazing and so supportive. I plan on continuing Cente workouts for a long time!,5,0,2020-06-23 03:26:06
"used other fitness apps before and them seem to get boring after awhile.by not engaging with the viewer or making the workout worth it that maybe them feel like a choir.so far I'm loving this app on my 4th straight week with one day off.100s off workout to choose from depending of your goals.the trainers are engaging and makes you feel like it's just you and them,egging you on through out the way to push yourself harder and give it your all.eatting plans included with easy to follow recipes 💪💪",5,0,2022-10-18 09:43:46
It would be very good to have favorites option and save videos and not to look for them through the app every time I want to come back to the specific workout.,4,0,2020-05-24 06:44:37
The workouts are fire along the content. Very well thought out and designed. I'm giving a 3 star review because this eats your data. There should be a download option to use offline like many other workout apps.,3,4,2020-01-31 01:39:43
"The center workout program is phenomenal, and the Centr team Has been a blessing to my life! Many of the workout programs on it, the meditations and the articles, have been a tremendous benefit to my life, and I would recommend Centr to everyone who hears about it! Thank you Chris Hemsworth and teams! You're such an inspiration to my life and I'm glad to be part of this fitness journey with you.",5,0,2023-01-05 20:02:30
"Awesome app. Recipes are great, but smoothies were the highlight for me. Takes the guess work out of getting fit. Yet to try the sleep meditations but they're supposed to be amazing",5,1,2021-11-21 05:10:53
"Fits so well to your fitness level, leaving me in a sweat after every workout! Not only does it have amazing exercises, but meditation and nutrition too! Best app to keep me on track!",5,1,2020-04-30 20:57:30
Work outs so far have been good. I'm doing the 6 week program. The warm up and downs have so far been all the same and don't really match what you do in the work out. Also would be good if they weren't just a copy and paste for each exercise in the work out.,3,0,2020-03-27 22:57:37
"I love the workouts! As someone who is heavily overweight and unfit I really like the programs and found them user friendly. I love that each coach is unique and their personality comes through the screen. In the first month my family watched me, now they're joining in with the centre 6. If possible I'd like to see a dance session workout. Also the yoga is a bit fast paced for beginners. Can the self guided workouts also be available to cast please?",4,1,2020-04-06 08:37:33
"Been with Centr since before the app, so glad the app has come out as it makes life so much easier. Following every single workout and actually making progress for once. Nutrition is a bit much for me as I'm dead fussy but I still use some of the recipes weekly, such as the Apple Pie Porridge 😍",5,0,2020-02-14 10:23:03
"I love this app, I love that a trainer coaches your through your workouts so I don't have to stop and look up what a certain exercise is and I love that there are different trainers and that we can swap our workouts out for a different oneif we're not feeling it that day. Its fun and easy to use with so much variety!",5,0,2020-07-29 22:04:04
"Transitioning from weight lifting centr has provided challenging workouts with far less pain. Additionally, by the end of each workout I feel like I've pushed myself to the limits with far less time than I normally spend at the gym. To add benefit, centr is extremely convenient and mobile. Making fitness simpler than it used to be.",5,7,2021-10-10 17:26:13

"Hard to navigate, cluttered app and they won't stop emailing me (unsubscribed several times before reporting as spam) Update: over a year later still getting spammed by Centr. They must be changing email addresses as I keep blocking them but they always show up again.",1,5,2021-11-15 12:46:22
The six week bodyweight program is fantastic. The beginner option is challenging but never feels unachievable. Its varied excercises keep you from getting bored and the community helps keep you committed,5,0,2020-06-06 09:11:43
7 day free trial requires credit card info no thanks. Tha act of requiring a credit card for a free trial is a only in the hopes that the person forgets to cancel. If it is truly a free trial why would you need the credit card you. give people 7days free and if they like the app they can ad their credit card infor and pay for it I am done with this mischievous way of developers doing business,1,0,2022-03-16 16:52:51
"Just another money grab, an annual subscription is nearltly £100...You could get an entire year's gym membership for that in a basic gym. YOU DO NOT need apps to get into shape! Utilise a consistent diet and workouts and you'll find that you have the power to do it all yourself.",1,5,2020-05-10 10:25:19
"Great app using it most mornings. Good variety of work outs. For an improvement I would suggest adding 2 things, being able to favourite work outs and meals and being able to build your own workout.",4,0,2020-05-22 08:10:37
I don't want to pay the £22:99 a month and I cannot see where to cancel before the free trial ends . Please advise. I tried going to the Google store subscription to cancel but the app is not listed and on the app I cannot see where it says settings,1,5,2020-01-08 20:48:50
"Es genial. Diversos ejercicios y deportes, los entrenadores son divertidos, las recetas muy ricas y muchas de ellas fáciles. Siempre tienes algo para tí cada día. It's great.

Don't know how or when I was signed up for this but it had to of been months ago. Now all of a sudden I get a $119 charge for something I didn't even know I was signed up for lol. And they email customer service just says to bad so sad we don't do refunds. This is just s money grab for Chris Hemsworth's name. Sad that people take advantage of others like this.,1,7,2023-02-17 21:58:49
"Ok so I've just downloaded the app today and starting my 7 day free trial, from the looks of things it seems pretty basic from first impressions, the meal and nutrition thing I think could be updated with a barcode scanner so you can scan foods and drinks you have got from the shop I.e a sandwich and drink ect, all in all I will give this a go and will also be keeping things documented on my YouTube channel (Nays Plays) and I will also be reviewing my experience with the app on there",2,1,2022-09-15 11:07:10

"I love this app alot, especially the amount of options and programs. I regularly do MMA HIIT and yoga which i hadnt done prior to using the app. One thibg i would suggest is since the latest update its a little difficult to navigate and there arent many vegan reciepes but all in all i think its fantastic.",5,3,2021-02-12 02:02:16
"This is truly the most holistic program out there. But that does not do it justice, it's not another health/fitness program, it's a Community, one that is rooting for you to succeed, supporting you when things are not great, cheering you on when you are tired but keep going, celebrating your smallest successes. The openess & availability of the team, trainers & community is astounding. No other package regularly uploads new recipes, workouts & challenges, fresh meditations & vital advice🤙💯🙇🏻",5,1,2020-02-14 08:48:12
Excellent app offering a broad range of programs from novice to advanced. My family love training with this app and we are now into our 2nd year of subscription. It has been one of the best investments in our health and well-being. Great job Centr team keep the updates and new programs coming!,5,1,2023-01-13 02:12:24
Absolutely the most comprehensive and thoughtful workout app I've ever seen and used. It's got everything you need for fitness success. I've never been unhappy with this app once.,5,1,2023-02-02 02:41:53
"The sleep meditation saves me almost every night. I wake up early in the morning and get a work out with Ashley, Luke, Michael, and Sylvia. She gave me a new respect for Pilates. Michael is one of my favorites, he has such a great character and then Ashely and Luke are amazing, fun and really get you pumped up for their work outs. I like that some of them aren't perfect, they goof up, they are humble, and uplifting. Makes its easier to work out at 430 in the morning before work.",5,5,2020-08-27 12:12:56
"Fantastic app - great value for so many different workouts, meal plans and help to keep you on track. I've used other fitness apps and this one is the best by a long way.",5,3,2019-12-31 05:38:12

"Impossible to cancel? Cancelled last year, received no confirmation. It renewed automatically this year with expired credit card info, still no confirmation of cancellation again this year... centr refuses to refund.

"A variety of day to day workouts, different trainers with different approaches and equipment at 3 modification levels, a large variety of delicious meals for meal planning, dedicated professionals that focus on mindfulness, stretching, meditation and yoga. And the 6 week program was a great addition that I hope to see mature -- doing it a 2nd time. All in all this is a fantastically well executed training & wellness app.",5,1,2020-04-10 11:33:12

Best workout app that I ever seen before. I highly recommend everyone to try this app. I saw the results within two weeks of workout program. Its worth to take subscription than spending on heavy prices for gyms and for trainers. The trainers in Centr gives the best workout plans for beginners to advanced. Thanks to Chris Hemsworth for providing this app. The diet plan is good though but It is difficult for Indian's to maintain the Australian diet plan.,5,8,2021-02-11 17:28:11

I wish their was more options to customize. Ex: the recipes to be dairy free. Their is some dietary restriction options but not that one and I'm milk protein allergic. Another Ex: I have diastasis recti and piriformis syndrome. Both cause some restrictions on exercises and it'd be nice to have the option to have those harmful exercises removed automatically. I already see pt for the fixing exercises but it's a pain to take every plan to him only to have 3/4 of it crossed off...,4,1,2023-01-09 04:31:19

I did the 6 weeks free in iso and have now joined up for the 3 months. Great variety of workouts depending what you have and feel on the day. Encouraging trainers and food recipes are great. As a mum with no time I have now been working out 4-5 times a week. It's addictive!,5,0,2020-06-29 09:07:57

"Really disappointed with the support team, I had an account made without my knowledge and a subscription wfee was taken tried getting help to be refunded as i never made the account but they say they cannot refund as a free trial was not cancelled.

"I've been using Centr for a couple months now and overall, a very solid workout app. Pros: - A multitude and variety of both individual workouts and programs - Meditation and sleep sessions are very relaxing. Plus, Chris Hemsworth is pretty hilarious. - Workout programs are much more cohesive and the videos are high quality. - The few meals I've made were tasty Cons: - Fairly expensive compared to other workout apps - The meals are hard to customize and require a LOT of prep/cook time",4,27,2020-11-27 03:50:47

"I will be paying for the one year subscription when my trial is up. I've been to the gym and tried online workout stuff at home. So far nothing has compared. You get the same coaching at the gym as you do at home in half the time. Plus, as a mom, I don't have to run after my kids in the gym. I've already noticed a difference in my diastasis recti. It was already almost healed but two days of exercises have really tightened everything up! Thank you Chris and staff!!!",5,6,2020-02-04 18:16:38
"I love this app. It takes the guesswork out of whatever your fitness goals are, and makes you feel as if you can indeed reach your goals. I very much appreciate the hard work of all who are on the centr team. Great product, great spirit, and you can feel the care of the contributing individuals. The price is worth it, and helps you remember the value of your purchase (pretty much I feel like I have to work out because I paid for it. 😏) Many thanks!",5,16,2021-02-03 17:35:39

"Workouts are amazing! There is always an alternative workout for those exercises where it requires gym equipment. I haven't come across an exercise I couldn't do yet. The workouts kick my a$$. Why only four stars? The meals they tell you to eat have ingredients that only high end stores carry, it's expensive and time consuming as hell.

The programs really challenge me to be the best that I can be and target the muscles. A big thing for me has been nutrition and Centr have created a balanced and nutritious meal plan. Having both fitness and nutrition work hand in hand like Centr's does has helped me for the better.,5,0,2020-06-06 23:10:53
Things that could be improved: 1) more education....why am I doing what I am doing? 2) form notes...especially with Torre Washington workouts 3) reps...ex. renegade rows..is that 8 reps total or both sides? 4) community. I joined the Facebook community but I found it lacking trainer support. It would be awesome to have someone able to answer questions.,3,0,2021-05-15 20:12:31
"Amazing. I hate exercise. I have finally committed to setting goals to get fit, stronger, toned and adopt new habits using Centr. After completing day 2 of the 7 day trial I was hooked. Great investment and affordable for me I chose 12 months. The program takes all the guess work out for me from workouts to meals. It also includes daily meditation and information to keep me motivated. Centr also has a private FB community you can join to keep you motivated, ask questions, share your progress.",5,5,2021-06-28 20:36:55
Overall really good app. Different body parts worked out each day. You don't have to think about what exercise the app does it all for you. Only issue I have had is some days the app doesn't appear to work.,4,1,2020-04-29 04:18:32

So far so great. Workouts are easy to understand. Diet is fairly easy to follow. I do wish some programs were more filling such as the one I'm doing now doesn't have me doing abs or triceps right now. It's a building muscle program.,4,0,2021-12-14 18:49:56

"I absolutely love this app!! The planner tells you all you need to do for that day(workout, meditation and food) to keep your goals in check. The new Centr6 program is amazing and a majority of the users are doing this program at the same time. The one thing that differentiates this app/program from others is the community associated with it. All of the people in the community keep each other excited and motivated to keep doing the program.",5,6,2020-02-15 10:48:16

"Great app, great program. The training is very well thought out and the recipes are economical, nutritious, and delicious. Just very hard to manage your account and customer service is kinda dodgy.

Lots of info and workouts on there. But not for beginners. I would have liked more options to the kind of work out - I cannot do a lot of high impact and don't have equipment in the house. I think this is for more serious gymgoers.,3,1,2020-01-05 09:31:08
Subscription seems unnecessary. I understand the same answer of removing the 7 day free trial but if that's the case then just apply a lock after the 7 days and you can still have people trying it out for free for 7 days. And if like you said it's connected to a Google account then you should be fine. I doubt anyone has the time to make 50 Google accounts just to get 50 free weeks of your app lol but overall the theme and layout looks cool. Uninstalled for lack of freedom.,1,2,2020-08-11 23:49:06

"Terrible, they took £93 after I cancelled my free trial. They won't refund as they say I must read the T&C and it's my fault. I explained I ended the free trial before the money was taken. They say I purposely activated but I was making sure I ended the free trial. They responded with sending me screenshots of the T&C. Absolute con. Update refund received with thanks",1,8,2020-08-12 06:57:18
I don't get to exercise everyday as I am a small business owner and my work is reasonably physical. However I do get to this app 3-4 times a week and can feel myself getting stronger each time so its happening. Will keep going as I'm only half way through week 2 of the beginner's coached workout.

"App is buggy & support from Centr is unreliable at best Still awaiting a response to an email I sent to them on 17 Oct & another query 4 days ago . Great marketing & cheap but when your 40 min workout stops 3 times & loses your spot, is it worth it, although the work outs & meals are great if its all working ok. Functionality & user friendliness has dropped in past year Edit 31/1/22 just read response from Centr below & LOL, I already emailed them 4 times! Did they even read the review!",2,0,2022-12-31 03:57:07

Work outs are awesome. I love that I can find workouts that don't require any equipment and still leave me feeling like I went to the gym. I have tried a few of the meals and the whole family has enjoyed them. Meditation sessions are great but I find that I run out of time to get one in most days. The few I have done have been very relaxing.,5,6,2021-05-24 16:09:27
"I love how the app is so well rounded and covers all aspects of health from physical to nutritional to mental. Couldn't imagine life without it now!!

I stopped using it after a month because I was doing almost the same every day. I wish I could get my money back",1,8,2020-12-06 20:17:52

The best futn sa app ever. Workouts and programs to fit in any level of practice. And the food and meditation recommended are a bonus!! A holistic approach that works and sticks,5,0,2022-08-18 04:53:23
"Cool app. Definitely helping me progress more and keeping me on track rather than trying to do everything myself. Although I would have liked to have seen workouts from Chris as well as all the team, as its him selling the thing. Hence 4 stars",4,7,2020-01-30 17:08:41
"No way to DELETE your account! Massive breach of privacy! Emailed them to ask to delete account - no response in more than a week. I work in IT, and no matter how good/bad/helpful the app is - if you can't sort out your data privacy/maintenance/retainability and deletion policy it is not worth it. Pretty poor on behalf of developer and bad oversight on behalf of Chris and his team. Takes one big data leak to bring all of this down.",1,3,2020-05-12 21:35:13
"Great app,allows me to take care of my body and mind. Also just a quick thought inspired by my Daughter. She is almost 4 and she asked me if she could have similar programm to exercise. I cannot find anything suitable for her age maybe Centr will help ?",5,2,2022-01-25 21:33:30
"Great workouts, awesome recipes and I love the ability to swap them to your needs. Enjoying all the no equipment workouts as well and modifications they show.",5,0,2020-05-31 16:00:21
"Best all around self improving and self care app. The app offers training (From MMA to yoga, muscle building and functional raw training), recipes (breakfast, snacks, shakes, gluten free to vegan you name it), meditations and sleep visualization (kids are hyper the app as a meditation for them) the app also offers blogs and quick tips starting everything with a weekly planner. Great customer service are always there. Join the community, you'll meet Centr legends from near and far! 💪💪",5,1,2020-04-28 22:04:13
The workouts are good and scalable for different levels however sticking with one trainer because repetitive as a lot of the workouts are just splices of each other. Good I a pinch.,4,3,2021-06-08 14:08:01
"This has renewed my love for fitness. Love the workouts as you're doing something new every day. Completed the centr 6 program of 6 weeks and now doing unleashed intermediate. Keeps me focused and works different areas everyday. It's great that you have access to yoga, pilates and loads of strength and hiit workouts too.",5,0,2020-05-27 10:33:40
"Stay away from this app. Upon sign up the app asks you to select a paid membership and u will get a 7 day free trial but as soon as u select a plan it deducts money from ur account and even if soon after u cancel u wont be refunded. I want refund To the Centr team, if you need money u need to let people trial first then charge them if they like the app, by charging them in advance using a scam technique no one will want to use this app. Literally feels like scam, I thought Chris's app is legit",1,3,2022-09-18 06:36:53
Best fitness app I ever used. The guided exercises are exactly what I needed to keep me going. The 6 weeks programs are also a blast and the meals are amazing.,5,0,2020-05-20 07:18:59
There is a ton of great individual workouts as well as programs and even a recipe and grocery guide. Its definitely a great app if you want to workout without equipment or minimal equipment 👍🏼,5,3,2020-09-04 03:01:31
So far so good. Investment worth the coaching. Don't have time for a gym so this has been a great substitute so far. Looking forward to more intense weight oriented workouts. Have not used the food portion yet but recipes look amazing,5,0,2022-06-28 13:14:20
"Same has other was not notified about renewal which is a bit strange to say the least, every other app ways notify before renewal. Very disappointed by the comments from Centr, not very helpful. I assume with the year we have all had this will have happened to so many people and due to having covid very severely , I have not even used the app since last year Poor customer service",2,26,2021-05-16 02:29:15

Great fast workouts that get results. Easy to do at home with options for minimal equipment and/or none. The meals are delicious also!,5,1,2021-04-07 23:02:33
I have been using this app for more than 14 months and committed to the workouts except the meal plan:p. So far I can see results are good but I'm confident if I stick to meal plan results will be extra ordinary Fingers crossed !!,4,1,2022-04-04 03:13:42
Good workouts and the app works now.,5,0,2023-08-29 06:06:57

"Ok, so hear me out, I got super stoned 1 night and bought the subscription as a joke, thinking it would magically turn me into Thor, didn't actually touch it for like 2 months, I'm NASM certified and was a competitive powerlifer for 4 years, when I sat down to draw up a nutrition plan and workout plan to get rid of my COVID weight my wife reminded me that I had got a year's subscription to actually use it, well I did and I may not go back OMG it's super easy to use and the workouts work 10 stars",5,0,2022-04-28 13:27:42
Makes you rush through the exercises and doesn't slow down to instruct on proper form for beginners. Whooping my ass daily but want to be sure I'm not going to strain something by rushing through circuits.,4,1,2020-04-18 15:47:27

"Brilliant app just a little difficult to find the right ingredients for the recipes in NZ. Update: Not sure if the app changed or they suddenly starting stocking the right things I needed but definitely seeing it work better, worthy of a god rating of 5 stars.",5,3,2021-07-21 23:50:22
"Fantastic all in one wellness app. Huge range of workouts and recipes plus meditation. I mostly love that every day is organised for me, all I've got to do is show up!",5,0,2022-02-15 08:29:37
I love it. The recipes are great and you can tailor it so its suits you (e.g. vegan for me- and there are loads of recipes- loads!). I love the meditation options too and the workouts are great. Currently doing the 6 week challenge and the half hour work outs easily fit into my day. Thanks!,5,14,2020-08-06 13:03:16
Excellent workouts with a great team with such varied but engaging personalities. Food menu is great too. I have some new favourite recipes which make me look like a decent cook!,5,3,2022-01-10 07:33:49
Downloaded for the Pilates workouts but impossible to follow along just from the audio and difficult to watch videos while doing it - ended up straining my next trying to watch which defeats purpose!,2,0,2020-03-31 16:09:01
"Great workouts and motivation, keeps you involved, glad to keep using it after the trial :) and ps it was very clear that after the trail you'd be charged the subscription fee YOU decided so those whinging on a current affair take some responsibility for your own actions and all complaining, well Done Chris, love what you're doing",5,0,2020-05-16 13:52:26
"a colleague recommended this app - he raves about it. i saw an add and entered my email address. i have received several marketing emails about their support for US children. i am not against that but, as an Australian, living in Australia, and as the app is promoted by an Austrlian that lives in Australia, i was dismayed that, should i join, i would be supporting the US and US children not Australian children",1,0,2023-01-02 21:53:35
"The right amount of motivation, variety, and customization I need! Plus learning new great tasting, easy to make, healthy recipes!",5,0,2021-02-23 14:49:51
Scam - Stay Away Got the app to try out as a big fan of Chris's outcomes and routine. Being 6'3 is not easy to gain like that. As a truck driver I waa curious to see what I could incorporate. Beware: The people doing this app for Chris will not work with you at all. Greed is king! What Happened: I signed up for the 7 day Free Trial and was advertised that 2 days prior we send you a reminder. The reminder never came and 1 year charge went through. Canceled same day as charge. Refund: DENIED,1,0,2021-06-29 11:17:41

"Absolutely terrible! These people are scams, they give you a free trial and then make it super hard to cancel and then charge you $119 and say they can't refund me! DO NOT FALL INTO THE TRAP! The training isn't even good, it's all about money.",1,9,2021-09-23 18:34:46
"I've never been so disappointed in an app. While the app itself may be decent, the people behind it only care about a profit. During a pandemic, when people are struggling and thoughts are elsewhere, this company will take money swiftly and leave a ""too bad so sad"" response. Be warned, you don't get alerted on upcoming payments like I've seen many apps do and if you respond right away saying there was an error you'll get nothing but copy and paste. Thanks alot guys, glad your doing so well.....",1,24,2021-01-01 22:55:40
"I needed a way to combat dad bod without leaving my poof wife at home alone with the kids by herself, and this was it. The meal planning alone is worth the money.

"First of all, the app looks good but The no equipment workouts are mostly mma and pilates, there is mostly no body weight workout with varietions, the meals are pretty expensive to make if u want sth simple. It's a bit exclusive for it's price and it doesn't offer much, don't recommend that",3,0,2020-03-26 07:12:49

"These workouts are not medium to small house friendly. They feel great, the coached workouts are well designed and flow well, the meal plans are very detailed, so if you're like me with a tiny kitchen and little to no space then I wish you luck. Otherwise everything about the app is fantastic, just seems to assume you have a minimum 2500 Sq ft house with a kitchen made for Gordan Ramsay. I would still recommend to anyone that wants to try this program out. Disclaimer, I bought the year on sale.",5,5,2022-01-11 18:38:58

Solid app but never works when I try to cast it to Google TV which is a huge bummer. Kind of makes you not want to pay $120 for it if you can't follow the workouts.,2,4,2023-04-18 22:25:27

Beginner level isn't for beginners. When the instructor is struggling to get through the session you can't call it beginner level.,3,3,2022-03-23 00:04:52
Like others are saying the app is very buggy. I'm on day three of my 7-day trial and I still can't use the app. Had to create an account on my laptop after the app failed.

"Not a fan of this app tbh. Yes you will lose weight on a 1500 calories diet! But you will be miserable & I highly doubt it would work for myself.

Well set out and structured.",5,0,2020-02-14 20:40:46
Usually just use YouTube workouts and liked those as a gym replacement. Thought I was fairly fit but wasn't seeing a huge difference in body and was definitely gaining covid weight. After 2 weeks of using this app I've already noticed changes in strength and fat loss. Love the meditation too and put it on before bed. I also have the down dog app and prefer that for yoga but to be fair I've only tried one yoga video on here and just rather stick with what I already love.,4,21,2020-10-14 15:48:39

"The routines and programs are all well thought out and if executed correctly(you have to push yourself and put in the hardwork) you will get a killer workout. The centr 6 program is fun, fast paced and one hell of a body burner. I love it so far. 2 weeks in on my first program and I can already see and feel a difference in my performance and physique.

A lot of people always want to get in shape, get healthy and so on, but usually get sidetracked by their very real lives as they let those goals become a passing day fantasy. If you know how to train, eat and stay healthy, you probably don't need this app, BUT if you're someone whose always lost in how to get from A to B, this is probably going to change your life over the months, and you down the road is totally worthy of that transformation.",5,11,2020-04-07 23:21:15

I enjoy the app and the workouts but don't quite understand / trust the nutrition facts for the recipes. They seem to be different based on male or female gender which doesn't make much sense to me personally.,3,0,2022-01-22 08:30:18
"Ugh. App stopped working, and I lost all progress after reinstall. Not sure I can trust a subscription with this app, if it's not stable :( I like the exercises though, so it's a shame",1,4,2020-05-15 21:41:37

Absolutely love the trainers. They make you feel like you are in the same room as they are during the workout. I'm currently doing the second 6 week program this year. I love the fact that I can easily complete the workouts at home and can swap out the daily workout if I don't have the equipment.,5,0,2020-06-15 11:22:08

"This app is boring & the voice overs make it super cheesy. There are so many fitness apps and streaming programs that are waaaayyy better than Centre. If I could give it 0 stars I would. Also, if you sign up and try to cancel they keep all of your $100+...Dont know what's worse, the app or the service. Seriously, don't bother. I'm absolutely convinced any positive reviews are as phony as this app is.",1,1,2022-02-10 23:35:58

Centr blew 2.5 Gb (half of my monthly plan) in half a week. This app urgently needs an offline mode because even with the videos turned off it devoured my data in less than two weeks. My gym doesn't provide wifi network so I literally cant use this app unless said offline mode is implemented.,2,3,2020-08-13 12:42:42
"""keep moving""... love this app, I chose the program with no equipment Unlimited which works perfectly for me as I feel the whole body working during the session.. just to keep myself tuned and fit♥️😍 Plus I hate thinking about what to cook so the Planner and Explore Meals section are real blessing for me. Moreover, quick meditations from Chris keep me positive during the day 🙌 such a great value for my money",5,0,2023-01-20 10:14:50

"I got centr on a free trial with amex. Overall I would be very disappointed if I paid for it. I tried centr unleashed for six weeks. I don't think the training they suggest will help grow strength or condition people. There is no repetition to a movement, for instance you'll get your heart rate elevated from running on the spot then move into a crab walk which decreases the heart rate. For upper body there is no repetition of pushups sets rather than get you to do 6 different types of push ups.",2,3,2021-08-30 02:32:22
I love the options of workouts. They are tough and also offer a less intensive option for those of us not quite at that level,5,1,2020-05-02 00:38:21

1 star and no less as I can't rate it worse.Extremelly poor customer service. Better you read every single line of the terms and conditions before signing up as if you want to cancel or have any issues they won't listen.,1,3,2022-02-16 08:10:19

Centr kept me in shape and staying healthy throughout the covid lock down. Starting out with no weights at the beginning and gradually getting dumbbells to add to my sessions. I feel much strong after completing each program.,5,2,2022-01-04 07:04:42

With a few small things I'd like to adjust aside this is truly an amazing app. Highly recommend. Everything all in one place and personalized.,5,3,2021-11-28 13:21:36
For someone who never does exercise I am 3 weeks into the beginner programme and I can feel myself getting fitter and stronger. I can do exercises now that I struggled with in week 1. I can stretch more and feel good for it. Thankyou 🙂,5,0,2021-01-14 11:43:46

Good mix or workout types and lengths and dietary info. I don't see a way to cast to a TV which makes it difficult though.,4,0,2020-06-14 01:31:20
"Who is this for? To get the most out of this app, you need access to a gym, but if I were already going to a gym, I'd rely on their trainers and resources or free material online over a paid app. It's not clear whether any of the no equipment workouts build muscle. They don't appear to if you compare the language with the gym ones. The gluten free, vegan, body building meal plans and shopping lists alone would be worth buying once (although ""or X alternative"" is a bit of a cop out).",3,0,2022-07-24 12:54:24

"I havent tried it yet and would like to but I just wish it was free a little like the beginner one at least. It's nice to know that you can do a free trial but I wish it was like maybe a month free trial but it's ok though. I have a hard time trying to lose the weight I have now and if i do the free trial and like it I just wish I wouldn't have to pay for it. But the app seems pretty cool and exciting so maybe in the future when I want to pay for it, I'll stick with it.",4,1,2019-12-26 17:56:56

Don't get it for more than a month. Meals and workouts get repetitive and are sometimes too complicated. Those workouts won't get you to look like Chris Hemsworth trust me. And their price is more expensive than my gym membership...,1,12,2020-07-28 11:40:57

"Giving this three stars and here's why. Chris is buff. And I understand there was at least one person behind him guiding him. And those people and Chris certainly deserve every bit of money they have made, but there are lots of free apps out there that will help you count calories and track your workouts etc. $200 for 12 months of an app that you're going to treat like a cheap gym membership is outrageous. Spending money won't motivate you, and Chris and his crew aren't gonna back you up",3,5,2021-09-05 08:48:19

At first I wanted to see more of Chris, but now I'm quite satisfied with seeing Luke, Michael, Da Rulk and Torre daily for my fitness fix.",5,1,2020-08-05 17:36:05
Really enjoying the variety workouts and advanced options. I'm usually at the gym 5-6 days so 2xHIIT and pilates/yoga each day is keeping me sane! Would be great to have a 'favourites' tab for workouts and meals instead of scrolling and trying to find ones you want :),4,1,2020-04-12 03:14:42

Never opened the app. Somehow got signed up for a year for $126 and called the day it hit my account and I realized there was a mistake. Zero understanding and wouldn't refund. Poor customer service.,1,19,2021-02-25 20:25:00
"This is great for people who don't work out often. For athletes and people who work out a lot, these workouts aren't enough. They're barely a warm up for me. If you're getting into fitness, go ahead and give it a try. If you've been doing this for a while, don't waste your time, you'll finish your first workout thinking, wait, that was it? and then have to figure out what you're going to do now that you're sufficiently warmed up.",3,3,2020-02-02 03:30:34

I downloaded the app because I think I saw that Hemsworth said it was free for a few weeks during the coronavirus quarantine. Wife and I work out with it almost every day for the last 3 weeks. I will definitely keep going after the trial is over.,5,1,2020-04-09 23:53:02

"If the only reason why anyone would pay way too much because it's Chris Hemsworth you must be hella gullible and love getting robbed. There are other free apps or pay fitness apps that cost 100x's less than this and does the exact same thing. For the daily diet there's thousands of diet plans on google that are free.

"I love the variations. Everyday I get to do different things, different challenges, working different muscle groups. I feel great. The whole team is awesome.",5,1,2020-04-04 18:01:34
"Totally misleading. Chris Hemsworth is not part of the videos like it appears before you get the app. And worse, when I wrote to ask for a refund because my 11 and 16 year old kids didn't want to do it because he was not part of the program. They said ""NO"". I signed up my children thinking that he would inspire them. Honestly things are not easy right now and for an actor who makes millions to say ""NO REFUNDS"", it's upsetting.",1,13,2020-05-12 21:43:08

"I joined Centr when it was offered for a free months trial because of Covid , I'm so glad I did , I use it every day , the recipes are really tasty and easy to do , and it's everything you already have in your cupboards.

Really clear instruction easy to follow for the most uncoordinated. Already seeing result in one week fitter more toned and flexible. Highly recommended,5,1,2020-09-05 10:40:45
I love the guided sessions. Especially when casting to big screen. Feels like I've got my own personal trainers at home with solid instruction wherever I have a spare 30 to 60 mins.,5,1,2020-07-04 23:06:29
"Not able to review the app, because it requires to fill-in a way of being charged in order to enter the trial period. I do not like giving such sensitive data if I am not to use the app for certain.",1,2,2020-03-25 23:41:15
Brilliant app contents is perfect for my life style. The app running could do with a work out as it's not a smooth operation.,4,0,2023-01-10 20:43:11
Would love more personalization through fit tests or some other form of specific training paths. More lifestyle goals as well. Best app on the market for guided exercise and nutrition/meal planning. Love you guys.,5,0,2023-03-03 18:09:05
Love the app! The food choices are dynamic and delicious and the workouts are super fun (and occasionally hella brutal).,5,0,2020-07-24 19:48:31

Great range! Loving the choice of workouts and using the mediation and sleep apps more than i expected! You def work up a sweat!,5,1,2020-04-19 04:26:22
Couldn't even give it a chance. I want to check it out on the 7 day free trial but it wouldn't let me sign up without entering my credit card info. I'm not comfortable handing out credit card info for an app that I might not even use after 7 days.,1,12,2021-11-29 22:22:04
This app is loaded with options to choose from. Great for beginners all the way to advanced workouts!,5,0,2020-07-02 12:38:03

Honestly great for morning body weight only cardio workouts as well as a few weighted workouts hear and there. So depending on what your workout life consists of this is a pretty complete package. In addition to the exercises there's also meal plans with directions on how to make so unique foods.,5,1,2022-02-27 14:36:10
Fantastic. Very comprehensive. Great workouts and well-being exercises. Nice user experience. Love it!,5,1,2020-08-24 16:17:15
Signed up for a subscription after seeing an article about a six week trial period during this covid 19 quarantine. After 7 days my card was charged the 29.99 because I signed up through the app and not on their website.,1,3,2020-04-03 06:10:29
"Best workout app/ program I've ever found. Incredible instructors, great exercise programs, and the price point can't be beat",5,2,2021-02-19 19:55:04

It also has meal plans for different needs, meditations, and as I said lots of options in types of exercises.",5,0,2020-08-04 15:56:12
The customer service is very rude. Just had a nice celebrity face on it. Auto renewed my subscription for the year without sending any notice and refuses to give any refund. SCAM,2,2,2021-05-28 13:34:34
Great app with lots of variety. May I suggest some sort of mindfulness during a commute to listen too as a future option,5,1,2021-11-30 22:37:43

Real enjoy using the app. The meal plan really helps to manage my diet and control portion sizes. The work outs are easy to do and switch search for ones with specific equipment and trainers,5,0,2020-06-04 16:09:29

This app is really good. But I don't recommend it for beginners. The 6 workout or whatever it's called has a beginner way to do it. However It shows you how to do the moves as you're doing them. So if you don't know how to do them. You might hurt yourself.,5,1,2020-02-11 01:30:58
Good for all fitness levels. Shows modifications for the exercises. I love the recipes.,5,1,2020-12-02 06:23:17

"Brilliant all round planner for meals, exercise and meditation. 100% would recommend for anyone who wants to change their lifestyle to a healthier one.",5,0,2021-01-23 09:38:08
"Great!! Would rate five stars IF.... My only complaint is that the self-guided workouts can't be cast to my TV. All of the guided workouts can without issue, so why not make the self guided ones the same way..?",4,4,2020-11-29 17:38:50
"I love the app, I always have a hard time coming up with a workout routine but centr makes it easy for me I love the intensity and variety of the exercises I never get bored with them",5,0,2021-05-10 04:30:42
This is kinda scam you don't get any notification regarding the deduction after the trial period and they take the money without your consent. I opted for 6 week trial period I didn't get any notification regarding its ending period and when i saw there was a deduction of an year payment... really bad experience didn't expect this to be like this when ambassador is a big start like Chris Hemsworth,1,5,2020-07-02 05:03:35
"Great recipes, challenging workouts... Love it! Definitely recommend doing the Centr 6 program, really helps you stick to it and see the benefits each week",5,1,2020-04-18 22:26:25
Recently I've noticed they have added more low impact workouts and modifications for those of us with knee issues. This has made working out so much more enjoyable!,5,2,2021-12-09 12:31:43
Great instructors. Balance of encouragement vs drive good. Low impact options great. Works well for me as an intermittently exercising 58yo with bad knees. Haven't missed a session. .first time in my life,5,1,2021-02-11 05:02:44
Absolutely LOVE the workouts they are intense and dont take too long! I feel amazing after I do them and there is a variety so you dont get bored!,5,1,2020-05-04 09:31:51

Recipes are amazing. Would be good to have a budget friendly zone. Centr6 is great though sometimes a little fast for me. Sleep visualisations are good to relax to,5,0,2020-04-05 21:34:49
At first glance my biggest concern is not having the ability to cast the workouts to my tv. Really hoping I have missed something as it seems silly to have to workout from my phone. Will keep searching,3,1,2020-04-03 23:07:42
"I like this app. Helps me a lot in this pandemic era to keep fit and stay healthy. But in centr power, the video has no audio. Please fix it...",4,1,2021-08-02 12:43:17

"Would not let me log in half of the time even tho I used the right password, forgot about it and was tricked into paying $100 for an app that pretends to be charitable by giving you 6 weeks free. Awful.",1,7,2020-05-05 02:44:36
The food and the gym are great but it would be perfect to have a tone up gym routine but their is just a build muscle routine for gym Would love it if the put a tone up version as currently using the build big muscle which isn't really my goal but no other options,3,0,2022-05-13 20:52:45

Absolute scamming b@stards. Sign up for a 3 month free trial and then a year later suddenly get whacked with a renewal for a year subscription? How the hell does that work? I wonder how small the small print must be on this one?,1,12,2021-05-07 19:29:27
Awesome! Love the variety and integration with healthy eating. The programs are excellent too!,5,1,2020-11-06 07:12:21
I came across a promotion for a free 6 week trial but after installing the app it declares a 7 day trial and guides me to register and then requests a choice for membership payment preference...? Is it the same app or is it a different program for the 6 week free trial?,3,0,2020-04-01 21:12:23

"30 dollars a month??? Doesn't even have in intermittent fasting options, can't input that you're allergic to seafood. Chris, you're an extremely, extremely wealthy individual. Stop being greedy. For 10/month it would be worth it",1,2,2023-04-01 16:32:40
Don't fall for this money grab. A good looking Hollywood guy is all he is. No doubt he works hard but so does everyone. This guy is training and eating on a multimillion dollar budget. Is he that greedy to prey on people who want to get in shape? I would never endorse something like this if I were him. Everything you need to get fit is free online with a little research. Being healthy is not something you pay a monthly fee to Chris Hemsworth for.,1,3,2020-01-27 04:25:35

I love this workout program and all the other features. The only thing I would change about this app is being able to download the workouts.,4,2,2019-12-27 14:33:45
Great collection of workout videos and recipes. Easily worth $10 a month if you need an at-home workout replacement with no equipment.,5,1,2020-12-07 17:38:41
I have been seeing all over the internet how this app is supposed to be free for 6 weeks but there isn't anything on the app itself except the 7 day free trial? And when I go through the site itself I says I have to pay 120 up front before I can use it.,2,2,2020-03-25 23:23:08

"Love this app, worth the cost. I no longer use a gym, and lots of bodyweight work outs. Would be good if there were more upper body, no equipment focussed work outs too.",5,0,2020-11-21 03:37:20

"Absolutely enjoy everything about this app and all the available options to work out, meal plan, and meditate. It offers something for everyone in the family.",5,0,2020-05-24 22:12:04
This is a scam. They are happy to charge you for service you don't want and refuse to refund you based on their fine print. Not a fitness app. Just a money making scheme.,1,2,2020-05-09 12:24:13
"So far, each session I have done has left me sweating with jelly like limbs...it's great!! I love the concentrated workouts, they fit so easily into my daily routine.",5,0,2022-02-02 19:02:47

"I have installed the app on March 28, and I could only see the 7 day free trial on the app. Left a question on the IG post, but no response at all. I have the screenshot where I asked the question on IG. I can send to you if needed. Thanks I don't get to see an option for 6 week free trial as he promotes. Is it because of my location?",1,3,2020-04-08 10:59:42

"This app has everything, workouts diets and mindfulness meditations for adults and children, of all ages and levels of fitness. Highly recommend.",5,0,2021-03-10 06:17:50

"Nice, customizable workout. I'm middle-aged and never worked out, and it's super easy to follow along and get the most out of it.",5,4,2021-06-16 03:32:31
"Good meal plans, but the workout program is a bit unrealistic and appears to have random workouts assigned to you making it harder to progress.",3,0,2020-08-24 22:40:44
It's good for short burst training - intermediate level is very challenging even if you are relatively fit - but the weekly program really pushes you,4,0,2020-05-31 11:32:02
"This app is amazing, um im just doing the newbie program but its really fun, and surprisingly the meditation stuff is gud too...i should be using the food suggestions but i just like food from my culture too much...baby steps😂 ( soundtrack is fire too)",5,0,2021-02-20 14:33:50

The recipes were great and the workouts were easy to follow for the most part. It's a great app and worth the money.,5,0,2022-05-29 16:21:02

Awesome trainers! Love the variance in the workouts that keeps me fresh and coming back. And the meal plan and recipes are exceptional! 4 months in and im not going anywhere else.,5,0,2020-08-04 19:00:22
It's a good app. The bad reviews are just from people who didn't read how the trials work. It's a good app with OR without weights if you play around with the app,5,2,2020-03-24 22:18:24
Very easy to use with a lot of option. Reallt good for all level of fitness .,5,1,2022-01-23 09:38:15

"If you had your own gym this app would be unreal. You could play the app on a big TV and use your exercise equipment. If you do not own a boxing bag, bench, cable machine, sandbags, dumb bells and bench DO NOT BUY THIS APP. Instead, buy a home workout app that does not involve equipment or gives you a planner to use in the gym.",1,13,2020-02-27 10:02:49

Can you guys add something for moms to make meal preps easy and reminders too would make a huge impact. Just a suggestion. Love the app overall.,4,0,2021-01-12 23:21:01

"It's just amazing Centr is with you from A-Z, from excercises to meals to information, even to a huge supportive community on FB. I actually never thought that I could one day start workingout and enjoy the diet meals, the recipes are just delicious. Who said that you gotta suffer with a diet?? The bottom line is that I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!",5,1,2021-03-01 14:32:06
"Only been using the app a couple of weeks but love the workouts, the recipes and the flexibility to tailor both to what you enjoy",5,1,2020-05-01 22:16:59
I love the yoga with Tahl!! She always reminds you to modify moves to fit your needs. It helps me to still complete the workouts while strengthening problem poses day by day.,5,1,2020-05-13 19:57:57
Love it! Some of the coached workouts that repeat 10 times get a bit boring so I much prefer the variety led workouts 😍,5,0,2021-03-19 10:38:17
Really helped me to get more variations in training and to get more flexible! Knowledge of how important stretching after is! Great work!,5,0,2022-06-18 07:13:09
The customer service is horrendous. Tried to cancel last year and was told it would be. Then got charged again this year and they will not refund. Very disappointed,1,9,2021-01-01 21:10:50
"Great selection of workouts, meals and snacks. Don't have to think about that anymore! Would be great to introduce low impact exercise for older people with bad knees.",4,4,2020-11-01 20:15:08
Sometimes the videos can stutter a bit. Everything else is great.,4,1,2020-04-16 18:05:25
"Got cheated... Centr has deducted the money from my account after 6 weeks without any intimation. The only time I got the intimation was 3 days after i joined. Even after I told them that I would not be using the app, they declined to refund shamelessly. They are basically forcing me to pay for the full year when i am explicitly declining to use their service. Please beware and don't get cheated!!!",1,2,2021-03-17 01:37:13
"Amazing, just what i need at home. Hard ,quick 30 min workout , meditation, sleep visualisations, food - easy ,quick recipies with no complicated ingredients. Ideal for busy people",5,0,2020-08-29 08:13:44

The app never opens. I've even uninstalled and then downloaded it again. I can't even get a good idea of the app by using the free trial. Why would I waste my money on it if I can't even access it? No thanks.,1,1,2020-03-25 01:04:21
Early days but so far highkights have been great variation of workouts and app itself really user friendly.,5,1,2021-03-03 18:26:03
"I like their programs and also the daily workout planner based on our objectives however the meals plan is almost 500+ calories which is more than my dietician recommended calorie intake, so I prefer to follow my own diet plan.",5,0,2022-05-12 17:35:43
Very impressed with the quality and variation of the workouts. Recipes and eating plans are also above average. I've been recommending this app to friends and family,5,1,2021-11-29 22:22:12

"Great App, and rarely any glitching. It gets a little blurry occationally. But that is all.",5,0,2020-07-31 03:42:11
Work outs are fantastic! Meal plans are definitely aimed at average and above sized men. I know how to reduce the calories for a given recipe but not everyone does.,4,0,2020-08-03 08:54:28
"Well - you can't just launch a new app and not have a no charge trial period even it's for 2days. Your 7-dsy trial after I give my credit card, isn't the same. No thanks even if this features Chris.",1,24,2020-01-18 17:55:17
Fantastic workouts. One of the best fitness app I've done in a long time with proven results. Highly recommend.,5,0,2021-09-30 04:40:02

"This is a really fun and effective way to work out at home. There are hundreds of workouts for all abilities. I didn't expect to keep this after the free six week trial, but I'm sold.",5,0,2020-05-29 04:31:01
I was charged 2months subscription and I have not got this app installed nor have I ever used it. I want my money returned ASAP. I have made a complaint to Google Play however I am yet to receive any reply!,1,3,2020-06-27 21:02:10
Good app! Make's me sweat..... which is good. Other apps do not have the same effect. Immersion is good. PS You should add a performance tracking.,5,1,2020-05-05 04:10:35
Excellent holistic approach to fitness and wellbeing with practical sessions and minimum equipment required. Loving it and am getting results!,5,0,2021-05-31 04:17:29

The cardio workouts are really good but so far the muscle workouts are not very interactive and quite boring.,3,0,2021-08-16 05:43:11
"Scam!!! They make their money by sucking people into signing up for their 7 day trial and hoping they forget to cancel. If they had any belief that their program had any value they would refund in a case like this instead of hiding behind their ""terms and conditions"". I agreed to it, I know, but they know I haven't used their program. Scammers!!!",1,9,2021-09-28 23:59:08
"Scam! Useless workouts and bad service tean. Don't try the ""free"" subscription it is difficult to cancel. Not worth trying this app at all! Just google trustpilot and centr to read more about this app.",1,1,2022-07-05 01:18:31
Great app. A holistic approach to health and fitness. I have been using it since the beginning. Happy to renew my subscription every time.,5,0,2021-09-03 11:37:16
I have never been successful with a home workout plan until now. All the trainers are amazing. And the online community is better than any gym I have ever walked into.,5,1,2020-12-05 14:10:27
"Honestly, if you can pay for the yearly subscription it's worth it, specially during quarantine. I recommend you start with the Centr Unleashed program!",5,0,2020-06-11 15:52:29
"In short, Centr keeps me going. I stopped like four days ago, and they send me an email. An email basically saying ""here, a much simpley, easy workout so you keep going. Don't stop mate."" And just like that i got back on track witb the program.",5,0,2020-08-25 21:55:57

"I needed to get back in the gym, but I didn't know where to start. I saw this app and thought I would try the free week and then unsubscribe. I was wrong! I love the workouts and I am in it for the long haul! Not just the workouts, but everything the app is about!",5,1,2021-06-15 01:58:52

"Awful. Terrible. SUPPORT SOMEONE THAT CARES (NOT CENTR) Let me say first, that I don't write things like this often. People that are out there violently reacting usually don't have very balanced perspectives. But my experience in this case was not just bad, it was unjust, unfair, and dishonest. I signed up for the free trial of Centr. It's a good app, but I decided the price wasn't worth it for me. So I cancelled it on the day I needed to (August 31 for reference). My card was still charged for $127. No matter how hard I try I can not get a refund. I don't care how good the app is, these guys are obviously out to make a dollar. They don't care that they are cheating me out of money. But it's not just me. By ignoring me, they prove that they care less about humanity and more about padding their own pockets. Until I receive proof that Centr actually cares about the people they claim to serve 1 star is the best I can do. Zero stars would be more appropriate. Support someone that cares, not these guys.",1,4,2020-09-19 16:29:55

"Wow! Google supporting an app that rips off consumers by charging an annual subscription when they don't want to be. Poor poor. What's worse when they are alerted to it, they refer to the t&c's. Unbelievable, charge a whole year's worth for being 24 hour slow. Is this how Chris Hemsworth supports his lifestyle millions at Byron Bay. This company is not ethnical or really cares. I'm sure the response will be a standard one from here, just to prove the zero care factor. Update - confirmed.",1,86,2020-11-27 11:41:15

Hola me encanta la app pero estoy disconforme porque hace un tiempo que ya no puedo compartirlo en mi televisor para poder ver la rutina de ejercicio en mi domicilio. Es sumamente incómodo estar mirando la pantalla del celular todo el tiempo. Sería muy bueno si arreglaran esto. Gracias,3,1,2021-06-18 00:42:42

"WARNING: They don't sent a notice of subscription renewal or even a receipt for payment. I had the yearly subscription and there was no reminder for me to cancel as ALL subscription services provide i.e. Amazon, Hello Fresh, etc. The only way I found out they took my money was when I looked at my bank account. They absolutely see nothing wrong with it and also DOWNRIGHT refuse to refund my money. Worst customer service. I am having my bank fight to refund my money.",1,2,2020-02-25 18:29:06
Couldn't even get to the download part despite interest because even though it says it only takes 6MB it requires me to clear out 144MB of space before it will allow download. I had no issue downloading a different app. Not entirely sure why it says 6MB when it's clearly a lot more.,1,1,2020-01-21 23:01:16
